<p>Implements the main user interface of the Tetrad application. The
    main user interface is a desktop that contains session workbenches
    driven by mouse gestures and menu commands. The form of the interface
    is described in the manual (please see).</p>

<p>A session workbench an interface presentation of a Session
    model. Please see the documentation for Session for further
    description. The session workbench allows various nodes to be
    constructed on the workbench that can be associated with various
    underlying models. A graphical stucture can then be defined over the
    nodes consistent with the parent objects needed to construct each
    model. The user sets these parent relationships by drawing edges
    between nodes in the workbench. The workbench provides a facility for
    constructing models in the various nodes, launching editors for those
    models, storing parameter objects for the models, launching parameter
    editors, and running automatic simulated sessions over the nodes.</p>

<p>Although the node types for a session of this type are in principle
    arbitrary, for the Tetrad application they are fixed to be the
    following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Graph
    <li>Parametric Model (PM)
    <li>Instantiated Model (IM)
    <li>Data
    <li>Estimator
    <li>Search
    <li>Graph Comparison
</ul>

<p>The toolbar for the workbench contains a button for each of these
    types, plus two additional buttons, one for selecting and moving nodes
    and the other for adding edges.</p>
