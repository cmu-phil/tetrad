/**
 * <p>Performs basic tests to ensure that sessions saved out with previous "stable"
 * versions of Tetrad will load with later "stable" version of Tetrad, where a "stable" version of Tetrad is a version
 * in some sequence V1, V2, ..., Vn of versions, each of which has a saved archive produced by the main() method of this
 * class, and each of which passes the testLoadability() method of this class with respect to the saved archives of each
 * previous version in the list. This test will red-flag any cases in which the name or package package path of a class
 * has been changed with respect to any previous version, or the type of any field has been made incompatible with the
 * type of a field by that same name in a previous version. It will also red-flag any cases in which a field has been
 * removed (or its name changed). It also checks the mundane things, like making sure serialVersionUID is set to a fixed
 * value, which is chosen to be 23L, making sure all TetradSerializable classes (that aren't TetradSerializableExcluded
 * and aren't abstract or interfaces) have serializableInstance() static constructors. If this test passes, then all
 * data from old sessions will be loaded back up, and mistakes of its use will be due to misinterpretation or ignoring
 * of old data by programmers. Adding fields is fine.&gt; 0
 *
 * <p>The test assumes that there is an identified set of public classes inside the
 * scope "serializableScope" (= "dir") that implement the TetradSerializable interface. It checks to make sure that each
 * serializable field of each of these classes is primitive, of a TetradSerializable type, of a type designated as safe
 * in the safelySerializableTypes array (see), or is an array of one of these types.&gt; 0
 *
 * <p>The test is as follows. First, the "getModel" directory is cleared, and then
 * the serializableInstance() method for each TetradSerializable class C in dir is called to produce a serializable
 * instance I of C. I is then serialized out to the "getModel" directory. At the same time, the list of field names for
 * each class is compiled, and this list is saved out to the "getModel" directory.&gt; 0
 *
 * <p>Next, serialized files in the "getModel" directory are deserialized, just make
 * sure this is possible. For default serialization (which we're using) this is not necessary, but if the default
 * serialization method is overridden, it's necessary to make sure fields are read in in the order they are written out,
 * so the test is included.&gt; 0
 *
 * <p>Finally, each serialized file in the archive saved out to the "archive"
 * directory is deserialized, just make sure this is possible. If anyone has moved or renamed a class, or changed the
 * type of a field to an incompatible type (where any change of primitive type is incompatible), which won't be
 * possible, and an exception will be thrown, with information about which archive the change conflict with. At the same
 * time, the list of fields for each class in each archive is read back in, and the classes in the getModel directory
 * are checked to make sure they have fields by those names. If getModel classes have fields by the same names as
 * previous versions of those classes, then the types of those fields  must be  compatible, since the deserialization
 * test for each archive must also pass. This guarantees that fields cannot be dropped or names of fields changed.&gt;
 * 0
 *
 * <p>The main() method of this class (called by Ant) performs one additional step,
 * when a new version of Tetrad is being posted online--namely, it zips up the "getModel" directory (produced in the
 * first step) and saves this zip file (an archive) to the "archives" directory. The point of this is to make sure
 * conflicts are only found with previous published versions and not with all previous versions. (Developmental versions
 * are counted as published versions.)&gt; 0
 *
 * <p>It is assumed that each instantiable TetradSerializable class C  in dir has a
 * static constructor of the following form:&gt; 0
 * <pre>
 * public static C* serializableInstance() {
 *     // Returns an instance of C, of type C* = C or some super class C*
 *     // of C (if this method is overriding a method of C*).
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>The instance returned may be mind-numbingly simple and may change over time.
 * The point is to make sure that instances serialized out with earlier versions load with the currentDirectory version,
 * and this is primarily a matter of ensuring that the type of each field in the earlier version is compatible with the
 * field in the later version of the same name, if a field in the later version by that name exists. It is not necessary
 * to consider different instantiations or subclasses of the type of a field, since all TetradSerializable classes are
 * already tested.&gt; 0
