        <td colspan="3">If the graph is a PAG and PAG coloring is turned on then the
            following are also true. (1) If an edge is solid, that means there is no latent
            confounder (i.e., the edge is visible, which means that for linear models its
            coefficient can be estimated); (2) If dashed, there is possibly a latent
            confounder (so that its coefficient may not be estimable). Also,
            (3) If an edge is thickened, that means the edge is definitely direct
            (which means that the directed edge appears in the true DAG).
            (4) Otherwise, if not thickened, the edge is possibly direct
            (which means the directed edge may or may not appear in the true DAG).

            a common latent child of two measured nodes, thus: X&rarr;Y&larr;Z and
            is indicated in an FCI-like graph as X&mdash;Y.
