        <td colspan="3"><b>PAG Coloring:</b> If the graph is a PAG and PAG coloring
            is turned on then the following are also true. (1) If an edge is solid, that
            means there is no latent confounder (i.e., the edge is visible, which means
            that for linear models its coefficient can be estimated); (2) If dashed, there
            is possibly a latent confounder (so that its coefficient may not be estimable).
            Also, (3) If an edge is thickened, that means the edge is definitely direct
            (which means that the directed edge appears in the true DAG). (4) Otherwise, if
            not thickened, the edge is possibly direct (which means the directed edge may or
            may not appear in the true DAG).

        <td colspan="3">Also, the above breakdown of types assume there is no
            <b>selection bias</b>. Selection bias occurs when there is
            a common latent child of two measured nodes, thus: X&rarr;(L)&larr;Y and
            is indicated in an PAG as X&mdash;Y.
