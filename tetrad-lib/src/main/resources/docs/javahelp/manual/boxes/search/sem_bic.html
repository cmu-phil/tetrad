<p> Calculates a linear, Gaussian BIC score score for continuous variables.
    The score decomposes for a DAG into the sum of the BIC scores for each
    variable given its parents. The child is regressed onto its parents and
    a residual calculated. The likelihood is calculated as function of the
    standard deviation of this residual. The usual BIC penalty is multipled
    by a constant c which we call the 'penalty discount'. This parameter
    controls for the sparsity of the output.
