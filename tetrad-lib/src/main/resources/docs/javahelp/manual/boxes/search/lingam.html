<p> LiNGAM ("Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model") refers to a type of model, but also to this
    particular algorithms. For this algorithm, ICA (Independence Components Analysis) is used
    to figure out a causal order for the variables (acyclicity assumed), and this immediately
    infers a causal DAG structure. This was the first algorithm which was able to infer a DAG
    structure and not a CPDAG, as conditional independence oracle algorithms do.

<p><em>Note: Zhang (2006) supplies an orientation rule set for FCI that is both arrow-complete and tail-complete; this
    is not currently implemented</em>. </p>
