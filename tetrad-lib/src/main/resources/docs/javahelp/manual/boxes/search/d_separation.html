<p> This is a property of graphs, in particular of directed graphs (possibly cyclic),
    and by extension to other graphs that represent equivalence classes over
    directed graphs or directed acyclic graphs. The definition for directed acyclic
    graphs is given in Pearl (1988); its extension to cyclic graphs is given in
    Spirtes (??). Under the assumption of faithfulness, X is d-separated from conditional
    in a set Z just in case X is independent of Y conditional on Z in the population,
    so running an algorithm using m-separation facts alone produces the output graph
    that would obtain under faithfulness if all conditional independence judgments
    were correct.
