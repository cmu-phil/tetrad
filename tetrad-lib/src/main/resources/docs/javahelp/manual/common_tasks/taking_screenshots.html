<p>Most editors in Tetrad, along with the main workspace area have a menu item in their File menu called &quot;Save
    Screenshot...&quot; Editors that display graphs also have a second menu item called &quot;Save Graph Image...&quot;
    These save PNG images of the dialog being displayed and the graph being displayed, respectively. </p>
<p>To show how these menu items function, consider the editor for Directed Acyclic Graphs. If you select Save Screenshot
    from the File menu of this editor, you wil see a Save dialog asking you for a filename. If you type a filename (or
    accept the default) click &quot;Save&quot; a PNG image will be saved for you that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img height="500" src="../images/dag_editor.png" width="550"></p>
<p>Notice that part of the graph is obscured. To save the entire image of just the graph, select &quot;Save Graph Image.&quot;
    If you do this, you will get an image something like this:</p>
<p><img height="400" src="../images/dag_graph_image.png" width="590"></p>
