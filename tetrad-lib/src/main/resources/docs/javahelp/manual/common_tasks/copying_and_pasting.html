<p>Nodes and subgraphs of nodes, either in the main session workspace or in any graph display, can be copied, cut, and
    pasted, either into the same workspace of graph or into some other workspace or graph.</p>
<p>To copy a section of a flowchart graph, first select the nodes you copy. The edges connecting those nodes will be
    copied as well. </p>
<p><img height="411" src="../images/copying1.gif" width="280"></p>
<p>Now select &quot;Copy&quot; from the Edit menu, or type Control-C. If you now select &quot;Paste&quot; from the Edit
    menu, or type Control-V, a copy of the selected nodes and edges will be pasted into the workspace slightly down and
    to the right of the original.</p>
<p><img height="376" src="../images/copying2.gif" width="246"></p>
<p>These selected nodes can now be dragged to the desired location. </p>
<p><img height="375" src="../images/copying3.gif" width="356"></p>
<p>If you select &quot;Cut&quot; (or type Control-X) instead of &quot;Copy&quot; (Control-C), the original nodes will be
    deleted, but you will still have the option of pasting copies of them into the workspace.</p>
<p>You may also paste multiple copies of the originally selected nodes into the workspace. These are pasted down and to
    the right in each case--e.g.:</p>
<p><img height="370" src="../images/copying4.gif" width="240"></p>
<p>All of these procedures work for nodes in graphs as well.<br>
