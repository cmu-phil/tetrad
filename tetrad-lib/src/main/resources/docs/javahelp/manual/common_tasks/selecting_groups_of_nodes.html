<table bgcolor="maroon" border="1" width="95%">
    <tr>

            <h2><font color="#FFFFFF">Selecting Groups of Nodes </font></h2>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If you would like to move a whole section of nodes, to copy them or move them to another location, first draw a
    &quot;rubberband&quot; around them and either drag one of the nodes to drag the group or select the copy function
    from the Edit menu to copy the group.</p>
<p>To draw a rubberband around a group of nodes, first click in the white background to the upper left of the group of
    nodes, then drag the mouse down to the lower right of the group of nodes. The rubberband will be shown as a dotted
    box around the group, and all of the nodes in the group will be highlighted. It will look like this:</p>
<p><img height="543" src="../images/rubberband1.gif" width="564"></p>
<p>Once selected, this group of nodes may, for example, be dragged to another location by clicking on X3 and dragging
    it. </p>
