<p>Tetrad is a suite of software for the discovery, estimation, and
        simulation of causal models. Some of the functions that you can perform
        with Tetrad include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Loading an existing data set, restricting
            potential models using your a-priori causal knowledge, and searching for
            a model that explains it using one of Tetrad’s causal search algorithms
        </li>
<li>Loading an existing causal graph and existing data set, and
            estimating a parameterized model from them
        </li>
<li>Creating a new causal
            graph, parameterizing a model from it, and simulating data from that
            model
        </li>
</ul>
<p>Tetrad allows for numerous types of data, graph, and model to be
        input and output, and some functions may be restricted based on what
        types of data or graph the user inputs. Other functions may simply not
        perform as well on certain types of data.</p>
<p>All analysis in Tetrad is performed graphically using a box
        paradigm, found in a sidebar to the left of the workspace. A box either
        houses an object such as a graph or a dataset, or performs an operation
        such as a search or an estimation. Some boxes require input from other
        boxes in order to work. Complex operations are performed by stringing
        chains of boxes together in the workspace. For instance, to simulate
        data, you would input a graph box into a parametric model box, the PM box
        into an instantiated model box, and finally the IM box into a simulation
        box.</p>
<p>In order to use a box, click on it in the sidebar, then click
        inside the workspace. This creates an empty box, which you can
        be instantiated by double-clicking. Most boxes have multiple options
        available on instantiation, which will be explained in further detail in
        this manual.</p>
<p>In order to use one box as input to another, draw an arrow between
        them by clicking on the arrow tool in the sidebar, and clicking and
        dragging from the first box to the second in the workspace.</p>
<p>Starting 1/14/2024, we will compile Tetrad under JDK 17 and use language level 17.</p>

<h1 id="graph_box"><span class="section_heading">Graph
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The graph box can be used to create a new graph, or to copy or
        edit a graph from another box.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Graph Box</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Another graph box</li>
<li>A parametric model box</li>
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>An estimator box</li>
<li>A data box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search box</li>
<li>An updater box</li>
<li>A regression box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Graph Box</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Another graph box</li>
<li>A compare box</li>
<li>A parametric model
            box
        </li>
<li>A data box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search
            box
        </li>
<li>A knowledge box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a New Graph</h2>
<p>When you first open a graph box with no parent, you will be
        presented with several options for which kind of graph you would like to
        create: a general graph, a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a structural
        equation model (SEM)graph, or a time lag graph. Once you have selected
        the type of graph you want to create, an empty graph box will open.</p>
<p>You can add variables to your graph by clicking on the variable
        button on the left, then clicking inside the graph area. Add edges by
        clicking on an edge type, then clicking and dragging from one variable to
        another. Variables may be measured (represented by rectangular icons) or
        latent (represented by elliptical icons). Edges may be directed,
        undirected, bidirected, or uncertain (represented by circles at the ends
        of an edge). Depending on the type of graph you choose to create, your
        choice of edges may be limited.</p>
<p><i>DAGs</i> allow only directed edges. If an edge would create a
        cycle, it will not be accepted. A graph box containing a DAG can be used
        as input for any parametric model box, and is the only kind of graph box
        that can be used as input for a Bayes parametric model.</p>
<p><i>SEM graphs</i> allow only directed and bidirected edges. A
        graph box containing a SEM graph can be used as input to a SEM parametric
        model or generalized SEM parametric model, where a bidirected edge
        between two variables X and Y will be interpreted as X and Y having
        correlated error terms.</p>
<p><i>Time lag graphs</i> allow only directed edges. New variables
        that you add will be initialized with a single lag. (The number of lags
        in the graph may be changed under “Edit—Configuration…”) Edges from later
        lags to earlier lags will not be accepted. Edges added within one lag
        will automatically be replicated in later lags. </p>
<p>The general <i>graph</i> option allows all edge types and
        configurations.</p>
<h2>Creating a Random Graph </h2>
<p>Instead of manually creating a new graph, you can randomly create
        one. To do so, open up a new empty graph box and click on “Graph—Random
        Graph.” This will open up a dialog box from which you can choose the type
        of random graph you would like to create by clicking through the tabs at
        the top of the window. Tetrad will randomly generate a DAG, a multiple
        indicator model (MIM) graph, or a scale-free graph. Each type of graph is
        associated with a number of parameters (including but not limited to the
        number of nodes and the maximum degree) which you can set.</p>
<p>Once a graph has been randomly generated, you can directly edit it
        within the same graph box by adding or removing any variables or edges
        that that type of graph box allows. So, for instance, although you cannot
        randomly generate a graph with bidirected edges, you can manually add
        bidirected edges to a randomly generated DAG in a SEM graph box.</p>
<p>Random graph generation is not available for time lag graphs. </p>
<h2>Loading a Saved Graph</h2>
<p>If you have previously saved a graph from Tetrad, you can load it
        into a new graph box by clicking “File—Load…,” and then clicking on the
        file type of the saved graph. Tetrad can load graphs from XML, from text,
        and from JSON files.</p>
<p>To save a graph to file, click “File—Save…,” then click on the
        file type you would like to save your graph as. Tetrad can save graphs to
        XML, text, JSON, R and dot files. (If you save your graph to R or dot,
        you will not be able to load that file back into Tetrad.)</p>
<p>You can also save an image of your graph by clicking “File—Save
        Graph Image…” Tetrad cannot load graphs from saved image files.</p>
<h2>Copying a Graph</h2>
<p>There are two ways to copy a graph. </p>
<p>To copy a graph from any box which contains one, first, create a
        new graph box in the workspace, and draw an arrow from the box whose
        graph you want to copy to the new graph box. When opened, the new graph
        box will automatically contain a direct copy of the graph its parent box
        contains. </p>
<h2>Manipulating a Graph</h2>
<p>If you create a graph box as a child of another box, you can also
        choose to perform a graph manipulation on the parent graph. Your graph
        box will then contain the manipulated version of the parent graph.</p>
<p>The available graph manipulations are:</p>
<h3>Display Subgraphs</h3>
<p>This option allows you to isolate a subgraph from the parent
        graph. Add variables to the subgraph by highlighting the variable name in
        the “Unselected” pane and clicking on the right arrow. The highlighted
        variable will then show up in the “Selected” pane. (You may also define
        which variables go in the “Selected” pane by clicking on the “Text
        Input…” button and typing the variable names directly into the window.)
        Choose the type of subgraph you want to display from the drop-down panel
        below. Then click “Graph It!” and the resulting subgraph of the selected
        variables will appear in the pane on the right. (Some types of subgraph,
        such as “Markov Blanket,” will include unselected variables if they are
        part of the subgraph as defined on the selected variables. So, for
        instance, an unselected variable that is in the Markov blanket of a
        selected variable will appear in the Markov Blanket subgraph. Edges
        between unselected variables will not be shown.) For large or very dense
        graphs, it may take a long time to isolate and display subgraphs.</p>
<p>The types of subgraphs that can be displayed are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Subgraph (displays the selected nodes and all
            edges between them)
        </li>
<li>Adjacents (displays the selected nodes and
            all edges between them, as well as nodes adjacent to the selected nodes)
        </li>
<li>Adjacents of adjacents (displays the selected nodes and all
            edges between them, as well as nodes adjacent to the selected nodes and
            nodes adjacent to adjacencies of the selected nodes)
        </li>
<li>Adjacents
            of adjacents of adjacents (displays the selected nodes and all edges
            between them, as well as nodes adjacent to the selected nodes, nodes
            adjacent to adjacencies of the selected nodes, and nodes adjacent to
            adjacencies of adjacencies of the selected nodes)
        </li>
<li>Markov
            Blankets (displays the selected nodes and all edges between them, as well
            as the Markov blankets of each selected node)
        </li>
<li>Treks (displays
            the selected nodes, with an edge between each pair if and only if a trek
            exists between them in the full graph)
        </li>
<li>Trek Edges (displays the
            selected nodes, and any treks between them, including nodes not in the
            selected set if they are part of a trek)
        </li>
<li>Paths (displays the
            selected nodes, with an edge between each pair if and only if a path
            exists between them in the full graph)
        </li>
<li>Path Edges (displays the
            selected nodes, and any paths between them, including nodes not in the
            selected set if they are part of a path)
        </li>
<li>Directed Paths
            (displays the selected nodes, with a directed edge between each pair if
            and only if a directed path exists between them in the full graph)
        </li>
<li>Directed Path Edges (displays the selected nodes, and any directed
            paths between them, including nodes not in the selected set if they are
            part of a path)
        </li>
<li>Y Structures (displays any Y structures
            involving at least two of the selected nodes)
        </li>
<li>Pag_Y Structures
            (displays any Y PAGs involving at least two of the selected nodes)
        </li>
<li>Indegree (displays the selected nodes and their parents)</li>
<li>Outdegree (displays the selected nodes and their children)</li>
<li>Degree (displays the selected nodes and their parents and
            children)
        </li>
</ul>
<h3>Choose Random DAG in CPDAG</h3>
<p>If given a CPDAG as input, this chooses a random DAG from the
        Markov equivalence class of the CPDAG to display. The resulting DAG
        functions as a normal graph box.</p>
<h3>Choose Zhang MAG in PAG</h3>
<p>If given a partial ancestral graph (PAG) as input, this chooses a
        mixed ancestral graph (MAG) from the equivalence class of the PAG
        to display using Zhang's method. The resulting MAG functions as a
        normal graph box.</p>
<h3>Show DAGs in CPDAG</h3>
<p>If given a CPDAG as input, this displays all DAGs in the CPDAG’s
        Markov equivalence class. Each DAG is displayed in its own tab. Most
        graph box functionality is not available in this type of graph box, but
        the DAG currently on display can be copied by clicking “Copy Selected
        Graph.”</p>
<h3>Generate CPDAG from DAG</h3>
<p>If given a DAG as input, this displays the CPDAG of the Markov
        equivalence class to which the parent graph belongs. The resulting CPDAG
        functions as a normal graph box.</p>
<h3>Generate PAG from DAG</h3>
<p>Converts an input graph from partial ancestral to directed acyclic
        format. The resulting DAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>
<h3>Generate PAG from tsDAG</h3>
<p>Converts an input graph from partial ancestral to time series DAG
        format. The resulting DAG functions as a normal graph box.</p>
<h3>Make Bidirected Edges Undirected</h3>
<p>Replaces all bidirected edges in the input graph with undirected
        edges.</p>
<h3>Make Undirected Edges Bidirected</h3>
<p>Replaces all undirected edges in the input graph with bidirected
        edges.</p>
<h3>Make All Edges Undirected</h3>
<p>Replaces all edges in the input graph with undirected edges.</p>
<h3>Generate Complete Graph</h3>
<p>Creates a completely connected, undirected graph from the
        variables in the input graph.</p>
<h3>Extract Structure Model</h3>
<p>Isolates the subgraph of the input graph involving all and only
        latent variables.</p>
<h3 id="ui-indicator-expansion">Discrete-to-Indicator Expansion</h3>
<p>
        In <b>Data ▸ Transform</b>, the new <b><i>Indicator</i></b> button converts
        a discrete column into <i>k−1</i> {0,1} dummies preserving rank.
    </p>
<h3 id="ui-bootstrap-options">Bootstrap “Sample w/out Replacement”</h3>
<p>
        The bootstrap dialog now offers <b>Without replacement</b>.
        Useful for exact subsampling when the sample size is small.
    </p>
<h2>Other Graph Box Functions</h2>
<h3>Edges and Edge Type Frequencies</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the graph box, the Edges and Edge Type
        Frequencies section provides an accounting of every edge in the graph,
        and how certain Tetrad is of its type. The first three columns contain a
        list, in text form, of all the edges in the graph. The columns to the
        right are all blank in manually constructed graphs, user-loaded graphs,
        and graphs output by searches with default settings. They are only filled
        in for graphs that are output by searches performed with bootstrapping.
        In those cases, the fourth column will contain the percentage of
        bootstrap outputs in which the edge type between these two variables
        matches the edge type in the final graph. All the columns to the right
        contain the percentages of the bootstrap outputs that output each
        possible edge type.</p>
<p>For more information on bootstrap searches, see the Search Box
        section of the manual.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>You can change the layout of your graph by clicking on the
        “Layout” tab and choosing between several common layouts. You can also
        rearrange the layout of one graph box to match the layout of another
        graph box (so long as the two graphs have identical variables) by
        clicking “Layout—Copy Layout” and “Layout—Paste Layout.” You do not need
        to a highlight the graph in order to copy the layout.</p>
<h3>Graph Properties</h3>
<p>Clicking on “Graph—Graph Properties” will give you a text box
        containing the following properties of your graph:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Number of nodes</li>
<li>Number of latent
            nodes
        </li>
<li>Number of adjacencies</li>
<li>Number of directed edges (not in 2-cycles)</li>
<li>Number of bidirected edges</li>
<li>Number of undirected edges</li>
<li>Max degree</li>
<li>Max indegree</li>
<li>Max outdegree</li>
<li>Average degree</li>
<li>Density</li>
<li>Number of latents</li>
<li>Cyclic/Acyclic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paths</h3>
<p>Clicking on “Graph—Paths” opens a dialog box that allows you to
        see all the paths between any two variables. You can specify whether you
        want to see only adjacencies, only directed paths, only potentially directed
        paths, or all treks between the two variables of interest, and the
        maximum length of the paths you are interested in using drop boxes at the
        top of the pane. To apply those settings, click “update.”</p>
<h3>Correlation</h3>
<p>You can automatically correlate or uncorrelated exogenous
        variables under the Graph tab.</p>
<h3>Highlighting</h3>
<p>You can highlight bidirected edges, undirected edges, and latent
        nodes under the Graph tab.</p>
<h1 id="compare_box"><span class="section_heading">Compare
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The compare box compares two or more graphs.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Compare box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>An instantiated model
            box
        </li>
<li>An estimator box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>A search
            box
        </li>
<li>A regression box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Compare box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<h2>Edgewise Comparisons</h2>
<p>An edgewise comparison compares two graphs, and gives a textual
        list of the edges which must be added to or taken away from one to make
        it identical to the other.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the following two graphs. The first is the
        reference graph, the second is the graph to be compared to it.
        When the Edgewise Comparison box is opened, a comparison like this
        appears:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_12.png" width="360"/>
<p>You may choose (by a menu in the upper left part of the box) whether the
        graph being compared is the original DAG, or the CPDAG of the original
        DAG, of the PAG of the original DAG</p>
<p>When the listed changes have been made to the second graph, it
        will be identical to the first graph.</p>
<h2>Stats List Graph Comparisons</h2>
<p>A stats list graph comparison tallies up and presents statistics
        for the differences and similarities between a true graph and a reference
        graph. Consider the example used in the above section; once again, we’ll
        let graph one be the true graph. Just as above, when the graphs are input
        to the tabular graph compare box, we must specify which of the graphs is
        the reference graph, and whether it contains latent variables. When the
        comparison is complete, the following window results:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>You may choose (by a menu in the upper left part of the box) whether the
        graph being compared is the original DAG, or the CPDAG of the original
        DAG, of the PAG of the original DAG</p>
<p>The first columns gives an abbreviation for the statistic; the
        second columns gives a definition of the statistic. The third columns
        gives the statistic value. </p>
<h2>Misclassifications</h2>
<p>A misclassification procedure organizes a graph comparison by edge
        type. The edge types (undirected, directed, uncertain, partially
        uncertain, bidirected, and null) are listed as the rows and columns of a
        matrix, with the true graph edges as the row headers and the target graph
        edges as the column headers. If, for example, there are three pairs of
        variables that are connected by undirected edges in the reference graph,
        but are connected by directed edges in the estimated graph, then there
        will be a 3 in the (undirected, directed) cell of the matrix. An
        analogous method is used to represent endpoint errors. For example:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_13.png" width="650"/>
<h2>Graph Intersections</h2>
<p>A graph intersection compares two or more graphs in the same
        comparison. It does so by ranking adjacencies (edges without regard to
        direction) and orientations based on how many of the graphs they appear
        in. In an n-graph comparison, it first lists any adjacencies found in all
        n graphs. Then it lists all adjacencies found in n – 1 graphs, then
        adjacencies found in n – 2 graphs, and so on. </p>
<p>After it has listed all adjacencies, it lists any orientations
        that are not contradicted among the graphs, again in descending order of
        how many graphs the orientation appears in. An uncontradicted orientation
        is one on which all graphs either agree or have no opinion. So if the
        edge X  Y appears in all n graphs, it will be listed first. If the edge
        X  Z appears in n – 1 graphs, it will be listed next, but only if the
        nth graph doesn’t contradict it—that is, only if the edge Z  X does not
        appear in the final graph. If the undirected edge Z – X appears in the
        final graph, the orientation X  Z is still considered to be
        uncontradicted.</p>
<p>Finally, any contradicted orientations (orientations that the
        graphs disagree on) are listed.</p>
<h2>Independence Facts Comparison</h2>
<p>Rather than comparing edges or orientation, this option directly
        compares the implied dependencies in two graphs. When you initially open
        the box, you will see the following window:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_6.png" width="650"/>
<p>The drop-down menu allows you to choose which variables you want
        to check the dependence of. If you select more than two variables, any
        subsequent variables will be considered members of the conditioning set.
        So, if you select variables X1, X2, and X3, in that order, the box will
        determine whether X1 is independent of X2, conditional on X3, in each of
        the graphs being compared. When you click “List,” in the bottom right of
        the window, the results will be displayed in the center of the window:
    </p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_7.png" width="650"/>
<h2>Edge Weight Similarity Comparisons</h2>
<p>Edge weight (linear coefficient) similarity comparisons compare
        two linear SEM instantiated models. The output is a score equal to the
        sum of the squares of the differences between each corresponding edge
        weight in each model. Therefore, the lower the score, the more similar
        the two graphs are. The score has peculiarities: it does not take account
        of the variances of the variables, and may therefore best be used with
        standardized models; the complete absence of an edge is scored as 0—so a
        negative coefficient compares less well with a positive coefficient than
        does no edge at all.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, an edge weight similarity comparison
        between the following two SEM IMs:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_8.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_9.png" width="360"/>
<p>When they are input into an edge weight similarity comparison, the
        following window results: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/compare_box_10.png" width="450"/>
<p>This is, unsurprisingly, a high score; the input models have few
        adjacencies in common, let alone similar parameters.</p>
<h2>Model Fit</h2>
<p>A model fit comparison takes a simulation box and a search box
        (ideally, a search that has been run on the simulated data in the
        simulation box), and provides goodness-of-fit statistics, including a
        Student’s t statistic and p value for each edge, for the output graph and
        the data, as well as estimating the values of any parameters. It looks
        and functions identically to the estimator box, but unlike the estimator
        box, it takes the search box directly as a parent, without needing to
        isolate and parameterize the graph output by the search.</p>
<h2>Markov Check</h2>
<p>
        The Markov Checker checks to see whether the Markov Condition is satisfied
        for a given graph. A simple version of the Markov Condition states that
        for any variable X, X is independent of all non-descendants of X given
        X’s parents. The Markov Checker will output all such implied independences
        and their p-values; these p-values should be distributed as U(0, 1) if the
        Markov Condition is satisfied, so violations can often be detected by
        plotting a histogram of these p-values or doing an Anderson-Darling test
        or a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to see if the hypothesis that they are drawn
        from a U(0, 1) distribution can be rejected. This sort of check is actually
        more general, since graphical implicaitons of separation are not limited to
        directect acyclic graphs (DAGs) but can be inferred from many types of
        graphs, including CPDAGs, MAGs, ADMGs, and PAGs.
    </p>
<p>
        Instructions for using the Markov Checker are included in the box itself,
        in the "Help" tab.
    </p>
<h2>IDA Check</h2>
<p>
        The IDA Checker check loops through all pairs of variable (X, Y) and
        calculates the IDA minimum effect for each X on Y, for a linear CPDAG
        model. The IDA minimum effect is the minimum effect of X on Y, regressing
        Y on S U {X} for all possible parent sets of X in the CPDAG. This gives
        a range of effects, and one then see whether the true effect of X on Y
        (as calculated from the true SEM IM) falls within this range. If it does
        not, then the IDA minimum effect is not consistent with the true effect.
    </p>
<p>
        The IDA check table gives information to help the user assess these results
        along with several summary statistics. Further instructions for using the
        IDA Checker are included in the box itself, in the "Help" tab.
    </p>
<h2>Algcomparison</h2>
<p>
        The Algcomparison (Algorithm comparison) tool allows the user to compare the
        results of multiple searches. The user can select one or more simulations,
        one or more algorithm (with selected test and/or score), and one or more
        table columns representing columns of parameter values or else statistics
        that are calculated based on the comparisons done. For most of these values,
        the use can specify multiple options for values, and the tool will iterate
        over all sensible combinations of these values and output a table of results.
        Full results, including all simulated dataset, all true graphs, all estimated
        graphs, and all timing results, are saved to the hard drive.
    </p>
<p>
        Further instructions for using the Algcomparison tool are included in the
        box itself, in the "Help" tab.

<h2>Bayes Parametric Models</h2>
<p>A Bayes parametric model takes as input a DAG. Bayes PMs represent
        causal structures in which all the variables are categorical.</p>
<p>Bayes PMs consist of three components: the graphical
        representation of the causal structure of the model; for each named
        variable, the number of categories which that variable can assume; and
        the names of the categories associated with each variable.</p>
<p>You may either manually assign categories to the variables or have
        Tetrad assign them at random. If you choose to manually create a Bayes
        PM, each variable will initially be assigned two categories, named
        numerically. If you choose to have Tetrad assign the categories, you can
        specify a minimum and maximum number of categories possible for any given
        variable. You can then manually edit the number of categories and
        category names.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the following DAG:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_1.png" width="360"/>
<p>One possible random Bayes PM that Tetrad might generate from the
        above DAG, using the default settings, looks like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>To view the number and names of the categories associated with
        each variable, you can click on that variable in the graph, or choose it
        from the drop-down menu on the right. In this graph, X1 and X2 each have
        three categories, and the rest of the variables have four categories. The
        categories are named numerically by default.</p>
<p>The number of categories associated with a particular variable can
        be changed by clicking up or down in the drop-down menu on the right.
        Names of categories can be changed by overwriting the text already
        present.</p>
<p>Additionally, several commonly-used preset variable names are
        provided under the “Presets” tab on the right. If you choose one of these
        configurations, the number of categories associated with the current
        variable will automatically be changed to agree with the configuration
        you have chosen. If you want all the categories associated with a
        variable to have the same name with a number appended (e.g., x1, x2, x3),
        choose the “x1, x2, x3…” option under Presets.</p>
<p>You can also copy category names between variables in the same
        Bayes PM by clicking on “Transfer—Copy categories” and “Transfer—Paste
        categories.”</p>
<h2>SEM Parametric Models</h2>
<p>The parametric model of a structural equation model (SEM) will
        take any type of graph as input, as long as the graph contains only
        directed and bidirected edges. SEM PMs represent causal structures in
        which all variables are continuous. </p>
<p>A SEM PM has two components: the graphical causal structure of the
        model, and a list of parameters used in a set of linear equations that
        define the causal relationships in the model. Each variable in a SEM PM
        is a linear function of a subset of the other variables and of an error
        term drawn from a Normal distribution.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a SEM graph and the SEM PM that Tetrad
        creates from it:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_3.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_4.png" width="450"/>
<p>You can see the error terms in the model by clicking
        “Parameters—Show Error Terms.” In a SEM model, a bidirected edge
        indicates that error terms are correlated, so when error terms are
        visible, the edge between X1 and X2 will instead run between their error
        terms.</p>
<p>To change a parameter’s name or starting value for estimation,
        double-click on the parameter in the window.</p>
<h2>Generalized SEM Parametric Models</h2>
<p>A generalized SEM parametric model takes as input any type of
        graph, as long as the graph contains only directed edges. (The
        generalized SEM PM cannot currently interpret bidirected edges.) Like a
        SEM PM, it represents causal structures in which all variables are
        continuous. Also like a SEM PM, a generalized SEM PM contains two
        components: the graphical causal structure of the model, and a set of
        equations representing the causal structure of the model. Each variable
        in a generalized SEM PM is a function of a subset of the other variables
        and an error term. By default, the functions are linear and the error
        terms are drawn from a Normal distribution (as in a SEM PM), but the
        purpose of a generalized SEM PM is to allow editing of these
        features.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a general graph and the default generalized
        SEM PM Tetrad creates using it:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_5.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_6.png" width="650"/>
<p>You can view the error terms by clicking “Tools: Show Error
        Terms.”

    <p>The Variables tab contains a list of the variables and the
        expressions that define them, and a list of the error terms and the
        distributions from which their values will be drawn. Values will be drawn
        independently for each case if the model is instantiated (see IM box) and
        used to simulate data (see data box).</p>
<p>The Parameters tab contains a list of the parameters and the
        distributions from which they are drawn. When the model in instantiated
        in the IM box, a fixed value of each parameter will be selected according
        to the specified distribution. </p>
<p>To edit an expression or parameter, double-click on it (in any
        tab). This will open up a window allowing you to change the function that
        defines the variable or distribution of the parameter.</p>
<p>For instance, if you double-click on the expression next to X1
        (b1*X5+E_X1), the following window opens:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_7.png" width="500"/>
<p>The drop-down menu at the top of the window lists valid operators
        and functions. You could, for example, change the expression from linear
        to quadratic by replacing b1*X5+E_X1 with b1*X5^2+E_X1. You can also form
        more complicated expressions, using, for instance, exponential or sine
        functions. If the expression you type is well-formed, it will appear in
        black text; if it is invalid, it will appear in red text. Tetrad will not
        accept any invalid changes. </p>
<p>Parameters are edited in the same way as expressions.</p>
<p>If you want several expressions or parameters to follow the same
        non-linear model, you may wish to use the Apply Templates tool. This
        allows you to edit the expressions or parameters associated with several
        variables at the same time. To use the Apply Templates tool, click
        “Tools: Apply Templates….” This will open the following window:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/parametric_model_box_8.png" width="500"/>
<p>You can choose to edit variables, error terms, or parameters by
        clicking through the “apply to” radio buttons. If you type a letter or
        expression into the “starts with” box, the template you create will apply
        only to variables, error terms, or parameters which begin with that
        letter for expression. For example, in the given generalized PM, there
        are two types of parameters: the standard deviations s1-s6 and the edge
        weights b1-b7. If you click on the “Parameters” radio button and type “b”
        into the “Starts with” box, only parameters b1-b7 will be affected by the
        changes you make.</p>
<p>The “Type Template” box itself works in the same way that the
        “Type Expression” box works in the “Edit Expression” window, with a few
        additions. If you scroll through the drop-down menu at the top of the
        window, you will see the options NEW, TSUM, and TPROD. Adding NEW to a
        template creates a new parameter for every variable the template is
        applied to. TSUM means “sum of the values of this variable’s parents,”
        and TPROD means “product of the values of this variable’s parents.” The
        contents of the parentheses following TSUM and TPROD indicate any
        operations which should be performed upon each variable in the sum or
        product, with the dollar sign ($) functioning as a wild card. For
        example, in the image above, TSUM(NEW(b)*$) means that, for each parent
        variable of the variable in question, a new “b” will be created and
        multiplied by the parent variable’s value, and then all the products
        will be added together.</p>

<h2>Bayes Instantiated Models</h2>
<p>A Bayes IM consists of a Bayes parametric model with defined
        probability values for all variables. This means that, conditional on the
        values of each of its parent variables, there is a defined probability
        that a variable will take on each of its possible values. For each
        assignment of a value to each of the parents of a variable X, the
        probabilities of the several values of X must sum to 1.</p>
<p>You can manually set the probability values for each variable, or
        have Tetrad assign them randomly. If you choose to have Tetrad assign
        probability values, you can manually edit them later.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a Bayes PM and its randomly created
        instantiated model:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>In the model above, when X4 and X5 are both 0, the probability
        that X5 is 0 is 0.0346, that X5 is 1 is 0.4425, and that X5 is 2 is
        0.5229. Since X5 must be 0, 1, or 2, those three values must add up to
        one, as must the values in every row.</p>
<p>To view the probability values of a variable, either double click
        on the variable in the graph or choose it from the drop-down menu on the
        right. You can manually set a given probability value by overwriting the
        text box. Be warned that changing the value in one cell will delete the
        values in all the other cells in the row. Since the values in any row
        must sum to one, if all the cells in a row but one are set, Tetrad
        will automatically change the value in the last cell to make the sum
        correct. For instance, in the above model, if you change the first row
        such that the probability that X5 = 0 is 0.5000 and the probability that
        X5 = 1 is 0.4000, the probability that X5 = 2 will automatically be set
        to 0.1000.</p>
<p>If you right-click on a cell in the table (or two-finger click on
        Macs), you can choose to randomize the probabilities in the row
        containing that cell, randomize the values in all incomplete rows in the
        table, randomize the entire table, or randomize the table of every
        variable in the model. You can also choose to clear the row or table.</p>
<h2>Dirichlet Instantiated Models</h2>
<p>A Dirichlet instantiated model is a specialized form of a Bayes
        instantiated model. Like a Bayes IM, a Dirichlet IM consists of a Bayes
        parametric model with defined probability values. Unlike a Bayes IM,
        these probability values are not manually set or assigned randomly.
        Instead, the pseudocount is manually set or assigned uniformly, and the
        probability values are derived from it. The pseudocount of a given value
        of a variable is the number of data points for which the variable takes
        on that value, conditional on the values of the variable’s parents, where
        these numbers are permitted to take on non-negative real values. Since we
        are creating models without data, we can set the pseudocount to be any
        number we want. If you choose to create a Dirichlet IM, a window will
        open allowing you to either manually set the pseudocounts, or have Tetrad
        set all the pseudocounts in the model to one number, which you
        specify.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a Bayes PM and the Dirichlet IM which Tetrad
        creates from it when all pseudocounts are set to one:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_3.png" width="650"/>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_4.png" width="650"/>
<p>In the above model, when X2=0 and X6=0, there is one (pseudo) data
        point at which X4=0, one at which X4=1, and one at which X4=2. There are
        three total (pseudo) data points in which X2=0 and X6=0. You can view the
        pseudocounts of any variable by clicking on it in the graph or choosing
        it from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. To edit the value of
        a pseudocount, double-click on it and overwrite it. The total count of a
        row cannot be directly edited.</p>
<p>From the pseudocounts, Tetrad determines the conditional
        probability of a category. This estimation is done by taking the
        pseudocount of a category and dividing it by the total count for its row.
        For instance, the total count of X4 when X2=0 and X6=0 is 3. So the
        conditional probability of X4=0 given that X2=0 and X6=0 is 1/3. The
        reasoning behind this is clear: in a third of the data points in which X2
        and X6 are both 0, X4 is also 0, so the probability that X4=0 given that
        X2 and X6 also equal 0 is probably one third. This also guarantees that
        the conditional probabilities for any configuration of parent variables
        add up to one, which is necessary.</p>
<p>To view the table of conditional probabilities for a variable,
        click the Probabilities tab. In the above model, the Probabilities tab
        looks like this: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_5.png" width="650"/>
<h2>SEM Instantiated Models</h2>
<p>A SEM instantiated model is a SEM parametric model in which the
        parameters and error terms have defined values. It assumes that
        relationships between variables are linear, and that error terms have
        Gaussian distributions. If you choose to create a SEM IM, the following
        window will open:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_6.png" width="450"/>
<p>Using this box, you can specify the ranges of values from which
        you want coefficients, covariances, and variances to be drawn for the
        parameters in the model. In the above box, for example, all linear
        coefficients will be between -1.0 and 1.0. If you uncheck “symmetric
        about zero,” they will only be between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a SEM PM and a SEM IM generated from it
        using the default settings: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_7.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_8.png" width="450"/>
<p>You can now manually edit the values of parameters in one of two
        ways. Double-clicking on the parameter in the graph will open up a small
        text box for you to overwrite. Or you can click on the Tabular Editor
        tab, which will show all the parameters in a table which you can edit.
        The Tabular Editor tab of our SEM IM looks like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_9.png" width="450"/>
<p>In the Tabular Editor tab of a SEM estimator box (which functions
        similarly to the SEM IM box), the SE, T, and P columns provide statistics
        showing how robust the estimation of each parameter is. Our SEM IM,
        however, is in an instantiated model box, so these columns are empty.</p>
<p>The Implied Matrices tab shows matrices of relationships between
        variables in the model. In the Implied Matrices tab, you can view the
        covariance or correlation matrix for all variables (including latents) or
        just measured variables. In our SEM IM, the Implied Matrices tab looks
        like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_10.png" width="450"/>
<p>You can choose the matrix you wish to view from the drop-down menu
        at the top of the window. Only half of any matrix is shown, because in a
        well-formed acyclic model, the matrices should be symmetric. The cells in
        the Implied Matrices tab cannot be edited.</p>
<p>In an estimator box, the Model Statistics tab provides goodness of
        fit statistics for the SEM IM which has been estimated. Our SEM IM,
        however, is in an instantiated model box, so no estimation has occurred,
        and the Model Statistics tab is empty.</p>
<h2>Standardized SEM Instantiated Models </h2>
<p>A standardized SEM instantiated model consists of a SEM parametric
        model with defined values for its parameters. In a standardized SEM IM,
        each variable (not error terms) has a Normal distribution with 0 mean and
        unit variance. The input PM to a standardized SEM IM must be acyclic.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an acyclic SEM PM and the standardized SEM
        IM which Tetrad creates from it</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_11.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_12.png" width="450"/>
<p>To edit a parameter, double-click on it. A slider will open at the
        bottom of the window (shown above for the edge parameter between X1 and
        X2). Click and drag the slider to change the value of the parameter, or
        enter the specific value you wish into the box. The value must stay
        within a certain range in order for the variables in the model to
        remain standard Normal (N(0, 1)), so if you attempt to overwrite
        the text box on the bottom right with a value outside the listed range,
        Tetrad will not allow it. That is, given that the variables are all
        distributed as N(0, 1), there is a limited range in which each parameter
        may be adjusted; these ranges vary parameter by parameter, given
        the values of the other parameters. In a standardized SEM IM, error
        terms are not considered parameters and cannot be edited, but you can
        view them by clicking Parameters: Show Error Terms. </p>
<p>It is possible to make a SEM IM with a time lag graph, even with latent
        variables. This does not work for other types of models, such as
        Bayes IMs or for mixed data (for which no IM is currently available--
        though mixed data can be simulated in the Simulate box with an appropriate
        choice of simulation model). Standardization for time lag model
        is not currently available.</p>
<p>The Implied Matrices tab works in the same way that it does in a
        normal SEM IM.</p>
<h2>Generalized SEM Instantiated Models</h2>
<p>A generalized SEM instantiated model consists of a generalized SEM
        parametric model with defined values for its parameters. Since the
        distributions of the parameters were specified in the SEM PM, Tetrad does
        not give you the option of specifying these before it creates the
        instantiated model.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a generalized SEM PM and its generalized SEM
        IM:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_13.png" width="450"/>
<img alt="" src="images/instantiated_model_box_14.png" width="450"/>
<p>Note that the expressions for X6 and X2 are not shown, having been
        replaced with the words “long formula.” Formulae over a certain
        length—the default setting is 25 characters—are hidden to improve
        visibility. Long formulae can be viewed in the Variables tab, which lists
        all variables and their formulae. You can change the cutoff point for
        long formulae by clicking Tools: Formula Cutoff.</p>
<p>If you double-click on a formula in either the graph or the
        Variables tab, you can change the value of the parameters in that
        formula. </p>

<h2>Using the Data Box:</h2>
<p>The data box stores the actual data sets from which causal
        structures are determined. Data can be loaded into the data box from a
        preexisting source, manually filled in Tetrad, or simulated from an
        instantiated model.</p>
<h2>Loading Data</h2>
<p>Data sets loaded into Tetrad may be categorical, continuous,
        mixed, or covariance data.</p>
<h3>General Tabular Data</h3>
<p>To load data, create a data box with no parent. When you double-click
        it, an empty data window will appear: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>Click "File -&gt; Load Data" and select the text file or files that
        contain your data. The following window will appear:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>The text of the source file appears in the Data Preview window.
        Above, there are options to describe your file, so that Tetrad can load
        it correctly. If you are loading categorical, continuous, or mixed data
        values, select the “Tabular Data” button. If you are loading a covariance
        matrix, select “Covariance Data.” Note that if you are loading a
        covariance matrix, your text file should contain only the lower half of
        the matrix, as Tetrad will not accept an entire matrix.</p>
<p>Below the file type, you can specify a number of other details
        about your file, including information about the type of data
        (categorical/continuous/mixed), metadata JSON file, delimiter between
        data values, variable names, and more. If your data is mixed (some
        variables categorical, and some continuous), you must specify the maximum
        number of categories discrete variables in your data can take on. All
        columns with more than that number of values will be treated as
        continuous; the others will be treated as categorical. If you do not list
        the variable names in the file, you should uncheck “First row variable
        names.” If you provide case IDs, check the box for the appropriate column
        in the “Case ID column to ignore” area. If the case ID column is labeled,
        provide the name of the label; otherwise, the case ID column should be
        the first column, and you should check “First column.”</p>
<p>Below this, you can specify your comment markers, quote
        characters, and the character which marks missing data values. Tetrad
        will use that information to distinguish continuous from discrete
        variables. You may also choose more files to load (or remove files that
        you do not wish to load) in the “Files” panel on the lower left.</p>
<h3>Metadata JSON File</h3>
<p> Metadata is optional in general data
        handling. But it can be very helpful if you want to overwrite the data
        type of given variable column. And the metadata MUST be a JSON file
        like the following example. </p>
<pre>
{
"domains": [
{
"name": "raf",
"discrete": false
},
{
"name": "mek",
"discrete": true
}
]
}
</pre>
<p> You can specify the name and data type for each variable.
        Variables that are not in the metadata file will be treated as domain
        variables and their data type will be the default data type when reading
        in columns described previously. </p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your description of your data, click
        “Validate” at the bottom of the window. Tetrad will check that your file
        is correctly formatted. If it is, you will receive a screen telling you
        that validation has passed with no error. At this point, you can revisit
        the settings page, or click “Load” to load the data. </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_3.png" width="650"/>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_4.png" width="650"/>
<p>You can now save this data set to a text file by clicking File:
        Save Data.</p>
<p>In addition to loading data from a file, you can manually enter
        data values and variable names by overwriting cells in the data
        table.</p>
<h3>Covariance Data</h3>
<p>Covariance matrices loaded into Tetrad
        should be ascii text files. The first row contains the sample size, the
        second row contains the names of the variables. The first two rows are
        followed by a lower triangular matrix. For example:</p>
<pre>
1000
X1  X2  X3  X4  X5  X6
1.0000
0.0312  1.0000
-0.5746 0.4168  1.0000
-0.5996 0.4261  0.9544  1.0000
0.8691  0.0414  -0.4372 -0.4487 1.0000
0.6188  0.0427  -0.1023 -0.0913 0.7172  1.0000
</pre>
<p>Categorical, continuous, or mixed data should also be an ascii
        text file, with columns representing variables and rows representing
        cases. Beyond that, there is a great deal of flexibility in the layout:
        delimiters may be commas, colons, tabs, spaces, semicolons, pipe symbols,
        or whitespace; comments and missing data may be marked by any symbol you
        like; there may be a row of variable names or not; and case IDs may be
        present or not. There should be no sample size row. For example:</p>
<pre>
X1  X2  X3  X4  X5
-3.0133 1.0361  0.2329  2.7829  -0.2878
0.5542  0.3661  0.2480  1.6881  0.0775
3.5579  -0.7431 -0.5960 -2.5502 1.5641
-0.0858 1.0400  -0.8255 0.3021  0.2654
-0.9666 -0.5873 -0.6350 -0.1248 1.1684
-1.7821 1.8063  -0.9814 1.8505  -0.7537
-0.8162 -0.6715 0.3339  2.6631  0.9014
-0.3150 -0.5103 -2.2830 -1.2462 -1.2765
-4.1204 2.9980  -0.3609 4.8079  0.6005
1.4658  -1.4069 1.7234  -1.7129 -3.8298
    </pre>
<h3>Handling Tabular Data with Interventional Variables</h3>
<p>This is an advanced topic for datasets that contain interventional
        (i.e., experimental) variables. We model a single intervention using two
        variables: status variable and value variable. Below is a sample dataset,
        in which `raf`, `mek`, `pip2`, `erk`, `atk` are the 5 domain variables,
        and `cd3_s` and `cd3_v` are an interventional pair (status and value
        variable respectively). `icam` in another intervention variable, but it's
        a combined variable that doesn't have status.</p>
<pre>
raf mek pip2    erk akt cd3_s   cd3_v   icam
3.5946  3.1442  3.3429  2.81    3.2958  0   1.2223  *
3.8265  3.2771  3.2884  3.3534  3.7495  0   2.3344  *
4.2399  3.9908  3.0057  3.2149  3.7495  1   0   3.4423
4.4188  4.5304  3.157   2.7619  3.0819  1   3.4533  1.0067
3.7773  3.3945  2.9821  3.4372  4.0271  0   4.0976  *
</pre>
<p>And the sample metadata JSON file looks like this:</p>
<pre>
{
"interventions": [
{
"status": {
"name": "cd3_s",
"discrete": true
},
"value": {
"name": "cd3_v",
"discrete": false
}
},
{
"status": null,
"value": {
"name": "icam",
"discrete": false
}
}
],
"domains": [
{
"name": "raf",
"discrete": false
},
{
"name": "mek",
"discrete": false
}
]
}
</pre>
<p>Each intervention consists of a status variable and value
        variable. There are cases that you may have a combined interventional
        variable that doesn't have the status variable. In this case, just use
        `null`. The data type of each variable can either be discrete or
        continuous. We use a boolean flag to indicate the data type. From the
        above example, we only specified two domain variables in the metadata
        JSON, any variables not specified in the metadata will be treated as
        domain variables.</p>
<h2>Manipulating Data</h2>
<p>The data box can also be used to manipulate data sets that have
        already been loaded or simulated. If you create a data box as the child
        of another box containing a data set, you will be presented with a list
        of operations that can be performed on the data. The available data
        manipulations are:</p>
<h3>Discretize Dataset</h3>
<p>This operation allows you to make some or all variables in a data
        set discrete. If you choose it, a window will open. </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_5.png" width="650"/>
<p>When the window first opens, no variables are selected, and the
        right side of the window appears blank; in this case, we have already
        selected X1 ourselves. In order to discretize a variable, Tetrad assigns
        all data points within a certain range to a category. You can tell Tetrad
        to break the range of the dataset into approximately even sections
        (Evenly Distributed Intervals) or to break the data points themselves
        into approximately even chunks (Evenly Distributed Values). Use the
        scrolling menu to increase or decrease the number of categories to
        create. You can also rename categories by overwriting the text boxes on
        the left, or change the ranges of the categories by overwriting the text
        boxes on the right. To discretize another variable, simply select it from
        the left. If you want your new data set to include the variables you did
        not discretize, check the box at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>You may discretize multiple variables at once by selecting
        multiple variables. In this case, the ranges are not shown, as they will
        be different from variable to variable.</p>
<h3>Convert Numerical Discrete to Continuous</h3>
<p>If you choose this option, any discrete variables with numerical
        category values will be treated as continuous variables with real values.
        For example, “1” will be converted to “1.0.”</p>
<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>The Calculator option allows you to add and edit relationships
        between variables in your data set, and to add new variables to the data
        set. </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_6.png" width="650"/>
<p>In many ways, this tool works like the Edit Expression window in a
        generalized SEM parametric model. To edit the formula that defines a
        variable (which will change that variable’s values in the table) type
        that variable name into the text box to the left of the equals sign. To
        create a new variable, type a name for that variable into the text box to
        the left of the equals sign. Then, in the box on the right, write the
        formula by which you wish to define a new variable in place of, or in
        addition to, the old variable. You can select functions from the
        scrolling menu below. (For an explanation of the meaning of some the
        functions, see the section on generalized SEM models in the Parametric
        Model Box chapter.) To edit or create several formulae at once, click the
        “Add Expression” button, and another blank formula will appear. To delete
        a formula, check the box next to it and click the “Remove Selected
        Expressions” button.</p>
<p>When you click “Save” a table will appear listing the data. Values
        of variables whose formulae you changed will be changed, and any new
        variables you created will appear with defined values.</p>
<h3>Merge Deterministic Interventional Variables</h3>
<p>This option looks for pairs of interventional variables (currently
        only discrete variables) that are deterministic and merges them into one
        combined variable. For domain variables that are fully determined,
        we'll add an attribute to them. Later in the knowledge box (Edges and
        Tiers), all the interventional variables (both status and value
        variables) and the fully-determined domain variables will be
        automatically put to top tier. And all other domain variables will be
        placed in the second tier.</p>
<h3>Merge Datasets</h3>
<p>This operation takes two or more data boxes as parents and creates
        a data box containing all data sets in the parent boxes. Individual data
        sets will be contained in their own tabs in the resulting box.</p>
<h3>Convert to Correlation Matrix</h3>
<p>This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs the lower half
        of the correlation matrix of that data set.</p>
<h3>Convert to Covariance Matrix</h3>
<p>This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs the lower half
        of the covariance matrix of that data set.</p>
<h3>Inverse Matrix</h3>
<p>This operation takes a covariance or correlation matrix and
        outputs its inverse. (Note: The output will not be acceptable in Tetrad
        as a covariance or correlation matrix, as it is not lower
        triangular.)</p>
<h3>Simulate Tabular from Covariance</h3>
<p>This operation takes a covariance matrix and outputs a tabular
        data set whose covariances comply with the matrix.</p>
<h3>Difference of Covariance Matrices</h3>
<p>This operation takes two covariance matrices and outputs their
        difference. The resulting matrix will be a well-formatted Tetrad
        covariance matrix data set.</p>
<h3>Sum of Covariance Matrices</h3>
<p>This operation takes two covariance matrices and outputs their
        sum. The resulting matrix will be a well-formatted Tetrad covariance
        matrix data set.</p>
<h3>Average of Covariance Matrices</h3>
<p>This operation takes two or more covariance matrices and outputs
        their average. The resulting matrix will be a well-formatted Tetrad
        covariance matrix data set.</p>
<h3>Convert to Time Lag Data</h3>
<p>This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs a time lag
        data set, in which each variable is recorded several times over the
        course of an experiment. You can specify the number of lags in the data.
        Each contains the same data, shifted by one “time unit.” For instance, if
        the original data set had 1000 cases, and you specify that the time lag
        data set should contain two lags, then the third stage variable values
        will be those of cases 1 to 998, the second stage variable values will be
        those of cases 2 to 999, and the first stage variable values will be
        those of cases 3 to 1000.</p>
<h3>Convert to Time Lag Data with Index</h3>
<p>This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs a time lag
        data set in the same manner as “Convert to Time Lag Data,” then adds an
        index variable.</p>
<h3>Convert to AR Residuals</h3>
<p>This operation is performed on a time lag data set. Tetrad
        performs a linear regression on each variable in each lag with respect to
        each of the variables in the previous lag, and derives the error terms.
        The output data set contains only the error terms.</p>
<h3>Whiten</h3>
<p>Takes a continuous tabular data set and converts it to a data set
        whose covariance matrix is the identity matrix.</p>
<h3>Nonparanormal Transform</h3>
<p>Takes a continuous tabular data set and increases its Gaussianity,
        using a nonparanormal transformation to smooth the variables. (Note: This
        operation increases only marginal Gaussianity, not the joint, and in
        linear systems may eliminate information about higher moments that can
        aid in non-Gaussian orientation procedures.) </p>
<h3>Convert to Residuals</h3>
<p>The input for this operation is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and
        a data set. Tetrad performs a linear regression on each variable in the
        data set with respect to all the variables that the graph shows to be
        its parents, and derives the error terms. The output data set contains
        only the error terms.</p>
<h3>Standardize Data</h3>
<p>This operation manipulates the data in your data set such that
        each variable has 0 mean and unit variance.</p>
<h3>Remove Cases with Missing Values</h3>
<p>If you choose this operation, Tetrad will remove any row in which
        one or more of the values is missing.</p>
<h3>Replace Missing Values with Column Mode</h3>
<p>If you choose this operation, Tetrad will replace any missing
        value markers with the most commonly used value in the column.</p>
<h3>Replace Missing Values with Column Mean</h3>
<p>If you choose this operation, Tetrad will replace any missing
        value markers with the average of all the values in the column.
        Replace Missing Values with Regression Predictions: If you choose this
        operation, Tetrad will perform a linear regression on the data in order
        to estimate the most likely value of any missing value.</p>
<h3>Replace Missing Values by Extra Category</h3>
<p>This operation takes as input a discrete data set. For every
        variable which has missing values, Tetrad will create an extra category
        for that variable (named by default “Missing”) and replace any missing
        data markers with that category.</p>
<h3>Replace Missing with Random</h3>
<p>For discrete data, replaces missing values at random from the list
        of categories the variable takes in other cases. For continuous data,
        finds the minimum and maximum values of the column (ignoring the missing
        values) and picks a random number from U(min, max)</p>
<h3>Inject Missing Data Randomly</h3>
<p>If you choose this operation, Tetrad will replace randomly
        selected data values with a missing data marker. You can set the
        probability with which any particular value will be replaced (that is,
        approximately the percentage of values for each variable which will be
        replaced with missing data markers).</p>
<h3>Bootstrap Sample</h3>
<p>This operation draws a random subset of the input data set (you
        specify the size of the subset) with replacement (that is, cases which
        appear once in the original data set can appear multiple times in the
        subset). The resulting data set can be used along with similar subsets to
        achieve more accurate estimates of parameters.</p>
<h3>Split by Cases</h3>
<p>This operation allows you to split a data set into several smaller
        data sets. When you choose it, a window opens. </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_7.png" width="360"/>
<p>If you would like the subsets to retain the ordering they had in
        the original set, click “Original Order.” Otherwise, the ordering of the
        subsets will be assigned at random. You can also increase and decrease
        the number of subsets created, and specify the range of each subset.</p>
<h3>Permute Rows</h3>
<p>This operation randomly reassigns the ordering of a data set’s
        cases.</p>
<h3>First Differences</h3>
<p>This operation takes a tabular data set and outputs the first
        differences of the data (i.e., if X is a variable in the original data
        set and X’ is its equivalent in the first differences data set, X’1 = X2
        – X1). The resulting data set will have one fewer row than the
        original.</p>
<h3>Concatenate Datasets</h3>
<p>This operation takes two or more datasets and concatenates. The
        parent datasets must have the same number of variables.</p>
<h3>Copy Continuous Variables</h3>
<p>This operation takes as input a data set and creates a new data
        set containing only the continuous variables present in the original.</p>
<h3>Copy Discrete Variables</h3>
<p>This operation takes as input a data set and creates a new data
        set containing only the discrete variables present in the original.</p>
<h3>Remove Selected Variables</h3>
<h3>Copy Selected Variables</h3>
<p>As explained above, you can select an entire column in a data set
        by clicking on the C1, C2, C3, etc… cell above the column. To select
        multiple columns, press and hold the “control” key while clicking on the
        cells. Once you have done so, you can use the Copy Selected Variables
        tool to create a data set in which only those columns appear.</p>
<h3>Remove Constant Columns</h3>
<p>This operation takes a data set as input, and creates a data set
        which contains all columns in the original data set except for those with
        constant values (such as, for example, a column containing nothing but
        2’s).</p>
<h3>Randomly Reorder Columns</h3>
<p>This operation randomly reassigns the ordering of a data set’s
        variables.</p>
<h2>Manually Editing Data</h2>
<p>Under the Edit tab, there are several options to manipulate data.
        If you select a number of cells and click “Clear Cells,” Tetrad will
        replace the data values in the selected cells with a missing data marker.
        If you select an entire row or column and click “Delete selected rows or
        columns,” Tetrad will delete all data values in the row or column, and
        the name of the row or column. (To select an entire column, click on the
        category number above it, labeled C1, C2, C3, and so on. To select an
        entire row, click on the row number to the left of it, labeled 1, 2, 3,
        and so on.) You can also copy, cut, and paste data values to and from
        selected cells. You can choose to show or hide category names, and if you
        click on “Set Constants Col to Missing,” then in any column in which the
        variable takes on only one value (for example, a column in which every
        cell contains the number 2) Tetrad will set every cell to the missing
        data marker.</p>
<p>Under the Tools tab, the Calculator tool allows you to add or edit
        relationships between variables in the graph. For more information on how
        the Calculator tool works, see “Manipulating Data” section above.</p>
<h2>Data Information</h2>
<p>Under the Tools tab, there are options to view information about your data in several
        formats.</p>
<p>The Plot Matrix tool shows a grid of scatter plots and histograms for selected variables.
        This may be used for continuous, discrete, or mixtures of continuous and discrete data.
        To select which variables to include in the rows and columns of the grid, click the variable
        lists to the right of the tool. To select multiple variables in these lists, use the shift
        or control keys when clicking; shift-click select ranges, whereas control-click will select
        additional single variables.</p>
<p>Histograms show the data distribution for a variable, with the width of each bar
        representing a range of values and the height of each bar representing how many data
        points fall into that range.</p>
<p>Scatter plots show a plot of variables taken two at a time. They plot values of one
        variable's values against another variable's values, point by point, and allow one
        to see the distribution of points for the pair of variables.</p>
<p>If viewing a grid of plots, one wishes to view a single plot in this grid, double-click on
        the desired plot, and it will be magnified so that it is in the only plot viewed.
        Double-click on the magnified plot to return to the grid.</p>
<p>The “Settings” menu contains some tools to control the output. One may add regression lines
        to the scatter plots or select the number of bins to include in the histograms.</p>
<p>Finally, one may condition on ranges of variables or particular discrete values by
        selecting “Edit Conditioning Variables and Ranges.” This brings up a dialog that lets one
        add conditioning variables with particular ranges for continuous variables or values for
        discrete values. For continuous ranges, one may pick “Above Average,” “Below Average,” or
        “In n-tile” (where n is specified) or give a particular range manually. One may add as many
        conditions as one prefers; when one clicks “OK,” all plots will be updated to reflect these
        conditioning choices.</p>

<p>The Q-Q Plot tool is a test for normality of distribution. </p>
<img alt="" src="images/data_box_10.png" width="650"/>
<p>If a variable has a distribution which is approximately Normal,
        its Q-Q plot should appear as a straight line with a positive slope. You
        can select the variable whose Q-Q plot you wish to view from the
        drop-down menu on the right.</p>
<p>The Normality Tests tool gives a text box with the results of the
        Kolmogorov and Anderson Darling Tests for normality for each variable.
        The Descriptive Statistics tool gives a text box with statistical
        information such as the mean, median, and variance of each variable.</p>
<h1 id="estimator_box"><span class="section_heading">Estimator
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The estimator box takes as input a data box (or simulation box)
        and a parametric model box and estimates, tests, and outputs an
        instantiated model for the data. Except for the EM Bayes
        estimator, Tetrad estimators do not accept missing values. If your data
        set contains missing values, the missing values can be interpolated or
        removed using the data box. (Note that missing values are allowed in
        various Tetrad search procedures; see the section on the search box.)</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Estimator Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A parametric model box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Estimator Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
<li>An
            updater box
        </li>
</ul>
<h2>ML Bayes Estimations</h2>
<p>Bayes nets are acyclic graphical models parameterized by the
        conditional probability distribution of each variable on its parents'
        values, as in the instantiated model box. When the model contains no
        latent variables, the joint distribution of the variables equals the
        product of the distributions of the variables conditional on their
        respective parents. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the joint
        probability distribution under a model is the product of the
        corresponding frequencies in the sample. </p>
<p>The ML Bayes estimator, because it estimates Bayes IMs, works only
        on models with discrete variables. The model estimated must not include
        latent variables, and the input data set must not include missing data
        values. A sample estimate looks like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/estimator_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>The Model tab works exactly as it does in a Bayes instantiated
        model. The Model Statistics tab provides the p-value for a chi square
        test of the model, degrees of freedom, the chi square value, and the
        Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) score of the model. Note that BIC
        is calculated as 2L -</p>
<h2>Dirichlet Estimations</h2>
<p>A Dirichlet estimate estimates a Bayes instantiated model using a
        Dirichlet distribution for each category. In a Dirichlet estimate, the
        probability of each value of a variable (conditional on the values of the
        variable’s parents) is estimated by adding together a prior pseudo count
        (which is 1, by default, of cases and the number of cases in which the
        variable takes that value in the data, and then dividing by the total
        number of cases in the pseudocounts and in the data with that
        configuration of values of parent variables. The default prior
        pseudo-count can be changed inside the box. (For a full explanation of
        pseudocounts and Dirichlet estimate, see the section on Dirichlet
        instantiated models.) </p>
<p>The Dirichlet estimator in TETRAD does not work if the input data
        set contains missing data values.</p>
<h2>EM Bayes Estimations</h2>
<p>The EM Bayes estimator takes the same input and gives the same
        output as the ML Bayes estimator, but is designed to handle data sets
        with missing data values, and input models with latent variables.</p>
<h2>SEM Estimates</h2>
<p>A SEM estimator estimates the values of parameters for a SEM
        parametric model. SEM estimates do not work if the input data set
        contains missing data values. A sample output looks like this: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/estimator_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>Tetrad provides five parameter optimizers: RICF,( Drton, M., &amp;
        Richardson, T. S. (2004, July). Iterative conditional fitting for
        Gaussian ancestral graph models. <i>In Proceedings of the 20th conference
            on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence</i> (pp. 130-137). AUAI Press).
        expectation­-maximization (EM), regression, Powell Journal of
        Econometrics 25 (1984) 303-325) and random search. Accurate regression
        estimates assume that the input parametric model is a DAG, and that its
        associated statistics are based on a linear, Gaussian model. The EM
        optimizer has the same input constraints as regression, but can handle
        latent variables. </p>
<p>Tetrad also provides two scores that can be used in estimation:
        feasible generalized the least squares (FGLS) and Full Information Maximum
        Likelihood (FML). </p>
<p>If the graph for the SEM is a DAG, and we may assume that the SEM
        is linear with Gaussian error terms, we use multilinear regression to
        estimate coefficients and residual variances. Otherwise, we use a
        standard maximum likelihood fitting function (see Bollen, Structural
        Equations with Latent Variables, Wiley, 1989, pg. 107) to minimize the
        distance between (a) the covariance over the variables as implied by the
        coefficient and error covariance parameter values of the model and (b)
        the sample covariance matrix. Following Bollen, we denote this function
        Fml; it maps points in parameter values space to real numbers, and, when
        minimized, yields the maximum likelihood estimation point in parameter
        space.</p>
<p>In either case, a Fml value may be obtained for the maximum
        likelihood point in parameter space, either by regression or by direct
        minimization of the Fml function itself. The value of Fml at this minimum
        (maximum likelihood) point, multiplied by N - 1 (where N is the sample
        size), yields a chi square statistics (ch^2) for the model, which when
        referred to the chi square table with appropriate degrees of freedom,
        yields a model p value. The degrees of freedom (dof) in this case is
        equal to the m(m-1)/2 - f, where m is the number of measured variables,
        and f is the number of free parameters, equal to the number of
        coefficient parameters plus the number of covariance parameters. (Note
        that the degrees of freedom many be negative, in which case estimation
        should not be done.) The BIC score is calculated as ch^2 - dof *
        log(N), so "higher is better.".</p>
<p>You can change which score optimizer Tetrad uses by choosing them
        from the drop-down menus at the bottom of the window and clicking
        “Estimate Again.”</p>
<p>The Tabular Editor and Implied Matrices tabs function exactly as
        they do in the instantiated model box, but in the estimator box, the last
        three columns of the table in the Tabular Editor tab are filled in. The
        SE, T, and P columns provide the standard errors, t statistics, and p
        values of the estimation.</p>
<p>The Model Statistics tab provides the degrees of freedom, chi
        square, p value, comparative fit index (CFI), root-mean-square error of
        approximation (RMSEA) and BIC score of a test of the model. It should be
        noted that while these test statistics are standard, they are not in
        general correct. See Mathias Drton, 2009, Likelihood ratio tests and
        singularities. Annals of Statistics 37(2):979-1012.
        arXiv:math.ST/0703360. Note also that BIC is calculated as 2L - k ln N,
        so "higher is better." </p>
<p>When the EM algorithm is used with latent variable models, we
        recommend multiple random restarts. The number of restarts can be set in
        the lower right hand corner of the Estimator Box.

    <h2>Generalized Estimator</h2>
<p>A generalized graphical model may have non-linear relations and
        non-Gaussian distributions. These models are automatically estimated by
        the Powell method, which seeks a maximum likelihood solution.</p>
<h1 id="updater_box"><span class="section_heading">Updater
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The updater box takes an instantiated model as input, and, given
        information about the values of parameters in that model, updates the
        information about the values and relationships of other parameters.</p>
<p>The Updater allows the user to specify values of variables as
        “Evidence.” The default is that the conditional probabilities (Bayes net
        models; categorical variables) or conditional means (SEM models;
        continuous variables) are computed. For any variable for which evidence
        is specified, the user can click on “Manipulated,” in which case the
        Updater will calculate the conditional probabilities or conditional means
        for other variables when the evidence variables are forced to have their
        specified values. In manipulated calculations, all connections into a
        measured variable are discarded, the manipulated variables are treated as
        independent of their causes in the graph, and probabilities for variables
        that are causes of the manipulated variables are unchanged. </p>
<p>There are four available updater algorithms in Tetrad: the
        approximate updater, the row summing exact updater, and the Junction Tree Updater,
        and the SEM updater. All except for
        the SEM updater function only when given Bayes instantiated models as
        input; the SEM updater functions when given a SEM instantiated model as
        input. None of the updaters work on cyclic models.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Updater Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>An estimator
            box
        </li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Updater Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>An instantiated model box (Note that the
            instantiated model will have the updated parameters)
        </li>
</ul>
<h2>Approximate Updater</h2>
<p>The approximated updater is a fast but inexact algorithm. It
        randomly draws a sample data set from the instantiated model and
        calculates the conditional frequency of the variable to be estimated.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the following instantiated model: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>When it is input into the approximate updater, the following
        window results:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>If we click “Do Update Now” now, without giving the updater any
        evidence, the right side of the screen changes to show us the marginal
        probabilities of the variables.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_3.png" width="360"/>
<p>The blue lines, and the values listed across from them, indicate
        the probability that the variable takes on the given value in the input
        instantiated model. The red lines indicate the probability that the
        variable takes on the given value, given the evidence we’ve added to the
        updater. </p>
<p>Since we have added no evidence to the updater, the red and blue
        lines are very similar in length. To view the marginal probabilities for
        a variable, either click on the variable in the graph to the left, or
        choose it from the scrolling menu at the top of the window. At the
        moment, they should all be very close to the marginal probabilities taken
        from the instantiated model.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll return to the original window. We can do so by clicking
        “Edit Evidence” under the Evidence tab. Suppose we know that X1 takes on
        the value 1 in our model, or suppose we merely want to see how X1 taking
        that value affects the values of the other variables. We can click on the
        box that says “1” next to X1. When we click “Do Update Now,” we again get
        a list of the marginal probabilities for X1.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_4.png" width="360"/>
<p>Now that we have added evidence, the “red line” marginal
        probabilities have changed; for X1, the probability that X1=1 is 1,
        because we’ve told Tetrad that that is the case. Likewise, the
        probabilities that X1=0 and X1=2 are both 0.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the updated marginal probabilities for X2, a
        parent of X1.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_5.png" width="360"/>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_6.png" width="360"/>
<p>The first image is the marginal probabilities before we added the
        evidence that X1=1. The second image is the updated marginal
        probabilities. They have changed; in particular, it has become much more
        likely that X2=0.</p>
<p>Under the Mode tab, we can change the type of information that the
        updater box gives us. The mode we have been using so far is “Marginals
        Only (Multiple Variables).” We can switch the mode to “In-Depth
        Information (Single Variable).” Under this mode, when we perform the
        update, we receive more information (such as log odds and joints, when
        supported; joint probabilities are not supported by the approximate
        updater), but only about the variable which was selected in the graph
        when we performed the update. To view information about a different
        variable, we must re-edit the evidence with that variable selected.</p>
<p>If the variable can take one of several values, or if we know the
        values of more than one variable, we can select multiple values by
        pressing and holding the Shift key and then making our selections. For
        instance, in the model above, suppose that we know that X1 can be 1 or 2,
        but not 0. We can hold the Shift key and select the boxes for 1 and 2,
        and when we click “Do Update Now,” the marginal probabilities for X2 look
        like this: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_7.png" width="650"/>
<p>Since X1 must be 1 or 2, the updated probability that it is 0 is
        now 0. The marginal probabilities of X2 also change: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_8.png" width="650"/>
<p>The updated marginal probabilities are much closer to their
        original values than they were when we knew that X1 was 1.</p>
<p>Finally, if we are arbitrarily setting the value of a
        variable—that is, the values of its parents have no effect on its
        value—we can check the “Manipulated” box next to it while we are we
        editing evidence, and the update will reflect this information.</p>
<p>Note that multiple values cannot be selected for evidence for SEM
        models.</p>
<h2>Row Summing Exact Updater</h2>
<p>The row summing exact updater is a slower but more accurate
        updater than the approximate updater. The complexity of the algorithm
        depends on the number of variables and the number of categories each
        variable has. It creates a full exact conditional probability table and
        updates from that. Its window functions exactly as the approximate
        updater does, with two exceptions: in “Multiple Variables” mode, you can
        see conditional as well as marginal probabilities, and in “Single
        Variable” mode, you can see joint values. </p>
<h2>Junction Tree Exact Updater</h2>
<p>The Junction Tree exact updater is another exact learning
        algorithm. Its window functions exactly as the approximate updater down,
        with one exception: in “Multiple Variables” mode, you can see conditional
        as well as marginal probabilities.</p>
<h2>SEM Updater</h2>
<p>The SEM updater does not deal with marginal probabilities;
        instead, it estimates means.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_9.png" width="360"/>
<p>When it is input to the SEM updater, the following window results:
    </p>
<img alt="" src="images/updater_box_10.png" width="650"/>
<p>Suppose we know that the mean of X1 is .5. When we enter that
        value into the text box on the left and click “Do Update Now,” the model
        on the right updates to reflect that mean, changing the means of both X1
        and several other variables. In the new model, the means of X2, X4, and
        X5 will all have changed. If we click the “Manipulated” check box as
        well, it means that we have arbitrarily set the mean of X1 to .5, and
        that the value of its parent variable, X4, has no effect on it. The
        graph, as well as the updated means, changes to reflect this.</p>
<p>The rest of the window has the same functionality as a SEM
        instantiated model window, except as noted above.</p>
<h1 id="knowledge_box"><span class="section_heading">Knowledge
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The knowledge box takes as input a graph or a data set and imposes
        additional constraints onto it, to aid with search.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Knowledge Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A graph box</li>
<li>A parametric model box</li>
<li>An instantiated model box</li>
<li>A data box</li>

</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Knowledge Box:</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A search box</li>
<li>Another knowledge box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tiers and Edges</h2>
<p>The tiers and edges option allows you to sort variables into
        groupings that can or cannot affect each other. It also allows you to
        manually add forbidden and required edges one at a time.</p>
<h3>Tiers</h3>
<p>The tiers tab for a graph with ten variables looks like this: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/knowledge_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>Tiers separate your variables into a timeline. Variables in
        higher-numbered tiers occur later than variables in lower-numbered tiers,
        which gives Tetrad information about causation. For example, a variable
        in Tier 3 could not possibly be a cause of a variable in Tier 1.</p>
<p>To place a variable in a tier, click on the variable in the “Not
        in tier” box, and then click on the box of the tier. If you check the
        “Forbid Within Tier” box for a tier, variables in that tier will not be
        allowed to be causes of each other. To increase or decrease the number of
        tiers, use the scrolling box in the upper right corner of the window.</p>
<p>You can quickly search, select and place variables in a tier using
        the Find button associated with each tier. Enter a search string into the
        Find dialogue box using asterisks as wildcard indicators. E.g., "X1*"
        would find and select variables X1 and X10.</p>
<p>You can also limit the search such that edges from one tier only
        are added to the next immediate tier e.g., if Tier 1 "Can cause only next
        tier" is checked then edges from variables in Tier 1 to variables in Tier
        3 are forbidden.</p>
<h3>Handling of Interventional Variables in Tiers</h3>
<p>If you have annotated your variables with interventional status
        and interventional value tags using a metadata JSON file (see Data Box
        section) the Tiers and Edges panel will automatically place these
        variables in Tier 1. If you have information about the effects of the
        intervention variables you can use the groups tab to indicate this.</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>The groups tab for a graph with four variables looks like this:
    </p>
<img alt="" src="images/knowledge_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>In the groups tab, you can specify certain groups of variables
        which are forbidden or required to cause other groups of variables. To
        add a variable to the “cause” section of a group, click on the variable
        in the box at the top, and then click on the box to the left of the
        group’s arrow. To add a variable to the “effect” section of a group,
        click on the variable in the box at the top, and then click on the box to
        the right of the group’s arrow. You can add a group by clicking on one of
        the buttons at the top of the window, and remove one by clicking the
        “remove” button above the group’s boxes.</p>
<h3>Edges</h3>
<p>The edges tab for a graph with four variables looks like this:
    </p>
<img alt="" src="images/knowledge_box_3.png" width="650"/>
<p>In the edges tab, you can require or forbid individual causal
        edges between variables. To add an edge, click the type of edge you’d
        like to create, and then click and drag from the “cause” variable to the
        “effect” variable.</p>
<p>You can also use this tab to see the effects of the knowledge you
        created in the other tabs by checking and unchecking the boxes at the
        bottom of the window. You can adjust the layout to mimic the layout of
        the source (by clicking “source layout”) or to see the variables in their
        timeline tiers (by clicking “knowledge layout”).</p>
<h2>Forbidden Graph</h2>
<p>If you use a graph as input to a knowledge box with the “Forbidden
        Graph” operation, the box will immediately add all edges in the parent
        graph as forbidden edges. It will otherwise work like a Tiers and Edges
        box.</p>
<h2>Required Graph</h2>
<p>If you use a graph as input to a knowledge box with the “Required
        Graph” operation, the box will immediately add all edges in the parent
        graph as required edges. It will otherwise work like a Tiers and Edges
        box.</p>
<h2>Measurement Model</h2>
<p>This option allows you to build clusters for a measurement model.
        When first opened, the window looks like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/knowledge_box_4.png" width="650"/>
<p>You can change the number of clusters using the text box in the
        upper right hand corner. To place a variable in a cluster, click and drag
        the box with its name into the cluster pane. To move multiple variables
        at once, shift- or command-click on the variables, and (without releasing
        the shift/command button or the mouse after the final click) drag. In the
        search boxes, these variables will be assumed to be children of a common
        latent cause.</p>
<h1 id="simulation_box"><span class="section_heading">Simulation

<h2>Using the Simulator Box</h2>
<p>When you first open the simulation box, you will see some
        variation on this window:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/simulation_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>The “True Graph” tab contains the graph from which data is
        simulated. </p>
<h3>The Simulation Box with no Input</h3>
<p>Because it has no input box to create constraints, a parentless
        simulation box offers the greatest freedom for setting the graph type,
        model type, and parameters of your simulated data. In particular, it is
        the only way that the simulation box will allow you to create a random
        graph or graphs within the box. (If you are simulating multiple data
        sets, and want to use a different random graph for each one, you can
        select “Yes” under “Yes if a different graph should be used for each
        run.”) You can choose the type of graph you want Tetrad to create from
        the “Type of Graph” drop-down list.</p>
<h5>Random Forward DAG</h5>
<p> This option creates a DAG by randomly adding forward edges (edges
        that do not point to a variable’s ancestors) one at a time. You can
        specify graph parameters such as number of variables, maximum and minimum
        degrees, and connectedness.</p>
<h5>Erdos Renyi DAG</h5>
<p> This option creates a DAG by randomly adding edges with a given edge
        probability. The graph is then oriented as a DAG by choosing a
        causal order.</p>
<h5>Scale Free DAG</h5>
<p> This option creates a DAG whose variable’s degrees obey a power
        law. You can specify graph parameters such as number of variables, alpha,
        beta, and delta values.</p>
<h5>Cyclic, constructed from small loops</h5>
<p> This option creates a cyclic graph. You can specify graph
        parameters such as number of variables, maximum and average degrees, and
        the probability of the graph containing at least one cycle.</p>
<p> It is very important when dealing with cyclic models to realize
        that the potential exists always to instantiate these models with
        coefficients that are too large. Always, to keep simulations from
        "exploding" ("diverging"--i.e., having simulation values that
        tend to infinity over time), it is necessary to make sure that
        coefficient values are relatively small, usually less than 1.
        One can tell whether a model will produce simulations that diverge
        in value by testing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
        of the data. If any of these eigenvalues are greater than 1,
        the potential exists for the simulation to "explode" toward
        infinity over time.</p>
<h5>Random One Factor MIM</h5>
<p> This option creates a one-factor multiple indicator model. You
        can specify graph parameters such as number of latent nodes, number of
        measurements per latent, and number of impure edges.</p>
<h5>Random Two Factor MIM</h5>
<p> This option creates a two-factor multiple indicator model. You
        can specify graph parameters such as number of latent nodes, number of
        measurements per latent, and number of impure edges.</p>
<p>In addition to the graph type, you can also specify the type of
        model you would like Tetrad to simulate.</p>
<h5>Bayes net</h5>
<p> Simulates a Bayes instantiated model. You can specify model
        parameters including maximum and minimum number of categories for each
        variable.</p>
<h5>Structural Equation Model</h5>
<p> Simulates a SEM instantiated model. You can specify model
        parameters including coefficient, variance, and covariance ranges.</p>
<h5>Linear Fisher Model</h5>
<p>Simulates data using a linear Markov 1 DBN without concurrent
        edges. The Fisher model suggests that shocks should be applied at
        intervals and the time series be allowed to move to convergence between
        shocks. This simulation has many parameters that can be adjusted, as
        indicated in the interface. The ones that require some explanation are as
        follows.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Low end of coefficient range, high end of
            coefficient range, low end of variance range, high end of variance range.
            Each variable is a linear function of the parents of the variable (in the
            previous time lag) plus Gaussian noise. The coefficients are drawn
            randomly from U(a, b) where a is the low end of the coefficient range and
            b is the high end of the coefficient range. Here, a &lt; b. The Gaussian
            noise is drawn uniformly from U(c, d), where c is the low end of the
            variance range and d is the high end of the variance range. Here, c &lt; d.
        </li>
<li>Yes, if negative values should be considered. If no, only
            positive values will be recorded. This should not be used for large
            numbers of variables, since it is more difficult to find cases with all
            positive values when the number of variables is large.
        </li>
<li>Percentage of discrete variables. The model generates continuous
            data, but some or all of the variables may be discretized at random. The
            user needs to indicate the percentage of variables (randomly chosen that
            one wishes to have discretized. The default is zero—i.e., all continuous
            variables.
        </li>
<li>Number of categories of discrete variables. For the
            variables that are discretized, the number of categories to use to
            discretize each of these variables.
        </li>
<li>Sample size. The number of
            records to be simulated.
        </li>
<li>Interval between shocks. The number of
            time steps between shocks in the model.
        </li>
<li>Interval between data
            recordings. The data are recorded every so many steps. If one wishes to
            allow to completely converge between steps (i.e., produce equilibrium
            data), set this interval to some large number like 20 and set the
            interval between shocks likewise to 20 Other values can be used, however.
        </li>
<li>Epsilon for convergence. Even if you set the interval between
            data recordings to a large number, you can specify an epsilon such that
            if all values of variables differ from their values one time step back by
            less than epsilon, the series will be taken to have converged, and the
            remaining steps between data recordings will be skipped, the data point
            being recorded at convergence.
        </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lee &amp; Hastie</h5>
<p> This is a model for simulating mixed data (data with both
        continuous and discrete variables. The model is given in Lee J, Hastie T.
        2013, Structure Learning of Mixed Graphical Models, Journal of Machine
        Learning Research 31: 388-396. Here, mixtures of continuous and discrete
        variables are treated as log-linear.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Percentage of discrete variables. The model
            generates continuous data, but some or all of the variables may be
            discretized at random. The user needs to indicate the percentage of
            variables (randomly chosen that one wishes to have discretized. The
            default is zero—i.e., all continuous variables.
        </li>
<li>Number of
            categories of discrete variables. For the variables that are discretized,
            the number of categories to use to discretize each of these variables.
        </li>
<li>Sample size. The number of records to be simulated.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Time Series</h5>
<p> This is a special simulation for representing time series.
        Concurrent edges are allowed. This can take a Time Series Graph as input,
        in which variables in the current lag are written as functions of the
        parents in the current and previous lags.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li>Sample size. The number of records to be
            simulated.

<h3>The Simulation Box with a Graph Input</h3>
<p>If you input a graph, you will be able to simulate any kind of
        model, with any parameters. But the model will be constrained by the
        graph you have input (or the subgraph you choose in the “True Graph”
        tab.) Because of this, if you create a simulation box with a graph as a
        parent, you will not see the “Type of Graph” option.</p>
<h3>The Simulation Box with a Parametric Model Input</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, a simulation box with a parametric model
        input acts as though the PM’s underlying graph had been input into the
        box.</p>
<h3>The Simulation Box with an Instantiated Model Input</h3>
<p>If you input an instantiated model, your only options will be the
        sample size of your simulation and the number of data sets you want to
        simulate; Tetrad will simulate every one of them based on the parameters
        of the IM. The model will not be re-parameterized for each run of the
        simulation.</p>
<h1 id="search_box"><span class="section_heading">Search
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The search box takes as input a data set (in either a data or
        simulation box) and optionally a knowledge box, and searches for causal
        explanations represented by directed graphs. The result of a search is
        not necessarily—and not usually—a unique graph, but an object such as a
        CPDAG that represents a set of graphs, usually a Markov Equivalence
        class. More alternatives can be found by varying the parameters of search
        algorithms.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Search Box</h2>

<h2>Using the Search Box</h2>
<p><b>For more information that in included about the search algorithms than
        is included in the text below, please see our
        <a href="https://www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad-javadocs/7.4.0/edu/cmu/tetrad/search/package-summary.html">
            Javadocs for the Search package</a>.</b></p>
<p>Using the search box requires you to select an algorithm
        (optionally select a test/score), confirm/change search parameters and
        finally run the search.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/search_box_1.png" width="650"/>
<p>The search box first asks what algorithm, statistical tests and/or
        scoring functions you would like to use in the search. The upper left
        panel allows you to filter for different types of search algorithms with
        the results of filtering appearing in the middle panel. Selecting a
        particular algorithm will update the algorithm description on the right
        panel.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct algorithm for your needs is an important
        consideration. Tetrad provides over 30 search algorithms (and more are
        added all the time) each of which makes different assumptions about
        the input data, uses different parameters, and produces different kinds
        of output. For instance, some algorithms produce Markov blankets or
        CPDAGs, and some produce full graphs; some algorithms work best with
        Gaussian or non-Gaussian data; some algorithms require an alpha value,
        some require a penalty discount, and some require both or neither. You
        can narrow down the list using the “Algorithm filter" panel, which allows
        you to limit the provided algorithms according to whichever factor is
        important to you.</p>
<p>Depending on the datatype used as input for the search (i.e.,
        continuous, discrete, or mixed data) and algorithm selected, the lower
        left panel will display available statistical tests (i.e., tests of
        independence) and Bayesian scoring functions.</p>
<p>After selecting the algorithm and desired test/score, click on
        "Set parameters" which will allow you to confirm/change the parameters of
        the search. </p>
<p>After optionally changing any search parameters, click on "Run
        Search and Generate Graph" which will execute the search.</p>
<p>Notably there are some experimental algorithms available in this box.
        To see these, select File-&gt;Settings-&gt;Enable Experimental.</p>
<h1 id="regression_box"><span class="section_heading">Regression
    Box</span></h1>
<p>The regression box performs regression on variables in a data set,
        in an attempt to discover causal correlations between them. Both linear
        and regression are available.</p>
<h2>Possible Parent Boxes of the Regression Box</h2>
<ul class="ul">
<li>A data box</li>
<li>A simulation box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Child Boxes of the Instantiated Model Box:</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Linear regression is performed upon continuous data sets. If you
        have a categorical data set upon which you would like to perform linear
        regression, you can make it continuous using the data manipulation
        box.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a data set with the following underlying causal
        structure:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/regression_box_1.png" width="360"/>
<p>When used as input to the linear regression box, the following
        window results: </p>
<img alt="" src="images/regression_box_2.png" width="650"/>
<p>To select a variable as the response variable, click on it in the
        leftmost box, and then click on the top right-pointing arrow. If you
        change your mind about which variable should be the response variable,
        simply click on another variable and click on the arrow again. </p>
<p>To select a variable as a predictor variable, click on it in the
        leftmost box, and then click on the second right-pointing arrow. To
        remove a predictor variable, click on it in the predictor box and then
        click on the left-pointing arrow.</p>
<p>Clicking “Sort Variables” rearranges the variables in the
        predictor box so that they follow the same order they did in the leftmost
        box. The alpha value in the lower left corner is a threshold for
        independence; the higher it is set, the less discerning Tetrad is when
        determining the independence of two variables.</p>
<p>When we click “Execute,” the results of the regression appear in
        the box to the right. For each predictor variable, Tetrad lists the
        standard error, t value, and p value, and whether its correlation with
        the response variable is significant. </p>
<p>The Output Graph tab contains a graphical model of the information
        contained in the Model tab. For the case in which X4 is the response
        variable and X1, X2, and X3 are the predictors, Tetrad finds that only X1
        is significant, and the output graph looks like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="images/regression_box_3.png" width="70"/>
<p>Comparison to the true causal model shows that this correlation
        does exist, but that it runs in the opposite direction.</p>
<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Logistic regression may be run on discrete, continuous, or mixed
        data sets; however, the response variable must be binary. In all other
        ways, the logistic regression box functions like the linear regression
        box. </p>

<h2>An Introduction to
        PAGs</h2>
<p>Peter Spirtes</p>
<p>The output of the FCI algorithm [Spirtes, 2001] is a partial
        ancestral graph (PAG), which is a graphical object that represents a set
        of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) that cannot be distinguished by the
        algorithm. Suppose we have a set of cases that were generated by random
        sampling from some CBN. Under the assumptions that FCI makes, in the
        large sample limit of the number of cases, the PAG returned by FCI is
        guaranteed to include the CBN that generated the data.</p>
<p>An example of a PAG is shown in Figure 2. This PAG represents the
        pair of CBNs in Figure 1a and 1b (where measured variables are in boxes
        and unmeasured variables are in ovals), as well as an infinite number of
        other CBNs that may have an arbitrarily large set of unmeasured
        confounders. Despite the fact that there are important differences
        between the CBNs in Figure 1a and 1b (e.g., there is an unmeasured
        confounder of X1 and X2 in Figure 1 b but not in Figure 1a), they share a
        number of important features in common (e.g., in both CBNs, X2 is a
        direct cause of X6, there is no unmeasured confounder of X2 and X6, and
        X6 is not a cause of X2). It can be shown that every CBN that a PAG
        represents shares certain features in common. The features that all CBNs
        represented by a PAG share in common can be read off of the output PAG
        according to the rules described next.</p>
<p>There are 4 kinds of edges that occur in a PAG: A -&gt; B, A o-&gt; B, A
        o–o B, and A &lt;-&gt; B. The edges indicate what the CBNs represented by the
        PAG have in common. A description of the meaning of each edge in a PAG is
        given in Table A1. </p>

<p>Table A1 is sufficient to understand the basic meaning of edge
        types in PAGs. Nonetheless, it can be helpful to know the following
        additional perspective on the information encoded by PAGs. Each edge has
        two endpoints, one on the A side, and one on the B side. For example A
        --&gt; B has a tail at the A end, and an arrowhead at the B end. Altogether,
        there are three kinds of edge endpoints: a tail "–", an arrowhead "&gt;",
        and a "o." Note that some kinds of combinations of endpoints never occur;
        for example, A o– B never occurs. As a mnemonic device, the basic meaning
        of each kind of edge can be derived from three simple rules that explain
        what the meaning of each kind of endpoint is. A tail "–" at the A end of
        an edge between A and B means "A is a cause of B"; an arrowhead "&gt;" at
        the A end of an edge between A and B means "A is not a cause of B"; and a
        circle "o" at the A end of an edge between A and B means "can't tell
        whether A is a cause of B". For example A --&gt; B means that A is a
        cause of B, and that B is not a cause of A in all the CBNs represented
        by the PAG. </p>
<p>The PAG in Figure 2 shows examples of each type of
        edge, and the CBNs. Figure 1. show some examples of what kinds of CBNs
        can be represented by that PAG. </p>

<h2>Arc Specializations in PAGs</h2>
<p>This section describes two types of edge specializations that
        provide additional information about the nature of an arc in a PAG.</p>
<p>One edge specialization is colored <span style="color:green">green</span> and is called <span style="font-style:
    italic; ">definitely visible</span>. In a PAG P without selection bias, a
        green (definitely visible) arc from A to B denotes that A and B do not
        have a latent confounder. If an arc is not definitely visible
        (represented as black) then A and B may have a latent confounder.</p>
<p>Another edge specialization is shown as <span style="font-weight:
    bold; ">bold</span> and is called <span style="font-style: italic;
    ">definitely direct</span>. In a PAG P without selection bias, a bold
        (definitely direct) arc from A to B denotes that A is a direct cause of
        B, relative to the other measured variables. If an arc is not definitely
        direct (represented as not bolded) then A may not be a direct cause of B,
        in which case there may be one or more measured variables on every causal
        path from A to B.</p>
<p>In the following examples, the DAG representing a causal process
        is on the left, and the corresponding PAG is on the right. All variables
        are observed except for latent variable L.</p>

<p>It is conjectured that it is not possible for an edge to be
        definitely direct (bold) and not definitely visible (black).</p>
<h2>Solving Out of Memory Errors</h2>
<p>By default, Java will
        allocate the smaller option of 1/4 system memory or 1GB to the Java virtual
        machine (JVM). If you run out of memory (heap memory space) running your
        analyses you should increase the memory allocated to the JVM with the
        following switch '-XmxXXG' where XX is the number of gigabytes of ram you
        allow the JVM to utilize. To run Tetrad with more memory you need to
        start it from the command line or terminal. For example to allocate 8
        gigabytes of ram you would add -Xmx8G immediately after the java command
        e.g., java -Xmx8G -jar tetrad-gui.jar.</p>
<h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>
<h5>Adjacent</h5>
<p>Two vertices in a graph are adjacent if there is
        a directed, or undirected, or double-headed edge between them.</p>
<h5>Degree</h5>
<p>The total number of edges directed both into and
        out of a vertex.</p>
<h5>Indegree</h5>
<p>The number of edges directed into a vertex.</p>
<h5>Markov Blanket</h5>
<p>In a variable set V, with joint
        probability Pr, the Markov Blanket of a variable X in V is the smallest
        subset M of V \ {X} such that X II V \ M | M. In a DAG model, the Markov
        Blanket of X is the union of the set of direct causes (parents) of X, the
        set of direct effects (children) of X, and the set of direct causes of
        direct effects of X.</p>
<h5>Markov Equivalent Graphs</h5>
<p>Two directed acyclic graphs
        (DAGS) are Markov Equivalent if they have the same adjacencies and for
        every triple X – Y – Z of adjacent vertices, if X and Z are not adjacent,
        X -&gt; Y &lt;- Z in both graphs or in neither graph.</p>
<h5>Meek Orientation Rules</h5>
<p>Rules for finding all directions
        of edges implied by a CPDAG, consistent with any specified “knowledge”
        constraints on directions. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4972.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.
            4972.pdf</a></p>
<h5>Mixed Ancestral Graph (MAG)</h5>
<p>An acyclic graph with
        directed and undirected edges. Directed edges have the same
        interpretation as in DAGs. Undirected edges represent common causes. See
        Richardson, T. (2003). Markov properties for acyclic directed mixed
        graphs. <em>Scandinavian Journal of Statistics</em>, 30(1), 145-157.</p>
<h5>Multiple Indicator Model</h5>
<p>A graphical model in which
        unmeasured variables each have multiple measured effects. There may be
        directed edges between unmeasured variables, but no directed edges from
        measured variables to unmeasured variables are allowed.</p>
<h5>Outdegree</h5>
<p>The number of edges directed out of a
        vertex.</p>
<h5>Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG)</h5>
<p>See PAG description in this
        manual.</p>
<h5>CPDAG</h5>
<p>A graphical representation of a Markov Equivalence
        Class or Classes, having both directed and undirected edges, with an
        undirected edge indicating that for each possible direction of the edge,
        there is a graph in the class or classes having that edge direction.</p>
<h5>Scale Free Graph</h5>
<p>A network in which the frequency of
        nodes with degree k obeys a power law--the relation between log of degree
        and log of frequency is roughly linear. See <a href="https://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/spring2013/section02/slides/
    10_ScaleFreeNetworks.pdf">https://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/
            spring2013/section02/slides/10_ScaleFreeNetworks.pdf</a>. </p>
<h5>Trek</h5>
<p>A trek between X and Y is a directed path from X to
        Y or from Y to X, or two directed paths from a third variable Z into X
        and Y that do not intersect except at Z.</p>
