== What is Jpgml ==

Jpgml is a Java porting of the Gaussian Process for machine learning software by C.E. Rasmussean and C. Williams. (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/).

The code is essentially identical to the one of the gpml library, however it has been repackaged in a more nodes oriented fashion in order to take full advantage of Java's capabilities.

In the current version only the part of the library that deals with regression has been implemented. 


A simple example of training and prediction can be found in the main method of the GaussianProcess class
