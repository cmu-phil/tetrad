 * editing material that can't easily update itself while the user edits matters. The editor should be either a
 * JComponent or a JDialog, if the form then <code>finalizeEdit()</code> will be called once the user has indicate that
 * they are finished editing so that the editor can collect and commit all the edits the user made. If
 * <code>finalizeEdit</code> returns false then the edit is aborted, as if they canceled it. And the other hand if the
 * editor is a Dialog then <code>finalizeEdit()</code> will be called right after <code>setup()</code> assuming that the
 * Dialog is modal and is handling matters on the users behalf.
