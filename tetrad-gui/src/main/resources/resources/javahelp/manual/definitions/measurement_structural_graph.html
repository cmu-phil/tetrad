<p>A specific graphical model where all observed variables are
indicators of some latent predictor (i.e., each observed modelNode has at
least one latent parent), and no observed predictor is a cause of any
latent predictor (but they may be causes of another observed variables).
The model describing which latents are causes of which observed
variables, and how the observed variables are related, is called the <strong>measurement
model</strong>. The model describing how latents are causally related
is called the <strong>structural model</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, we say that a measurement/structural model is <strong>pure</strong>
if every observed predictor has only one latent parent, and no pair of
observed variables is connected by a path that does not include a
latent predictor of the model. The following figure illustrates a pure
measurement/structural model.</p>
