<h3>Provide descriptive statistics?</h3>
<p> - Because those statistics can easily be obtained in Excel or Matlab</p>
<h3><br>
  Transform variables, e.g., by taking logs</h3>
<p> - Because this can be done in common commercial packages</p>
<h3><br>
  Do linear regression analysis?</h3>
<p> - Same answer.</p>
<h3><br>
  Use logistic regression or log-linear models?</h3>
<p> - These regression procedures could be valuable in estimating parameters in 
  Bayes nets, but they require a sound search procedure for selecting interaction 
  terms, and we haven't solved that yet.</p>
<h3><br>
  Do factor analysis?</h3>
<p> - Probably it should. For many problems, however, the latent variable search 
  procedure in Tetrad is preferable.</p>
<h3><br>
  Deal with non-Normal distributions for continuous variables?</h3>
<p> -Relevant statistics are available only for Normal, Multinomial and Conditional 
  Gaussian distribution families; the last should be included. </p>
<h3><br>
  Provide all of the models consistent with search output, instead of "patterns," 
  PAGs" etc.</h3>
<p>- The models corresponding to a pattern could and perhaps should be provided, 
  but their an infinite number of models consistent with a PAG, and your computer 
  is finite.</p>
<h3><br>
  Provide Bayesain search procedures when there may be latent variables?</h3>
<p> - No consistent, computationally feasible, general algoirithms are known.</p>
<h3><br>
  Provide search procedures for cyclic (non-recursive) models with latent variables</h3>
<p> - No consistent search procedures are known.</p>
<h3><br>
  Provide search procedures for time series?</h3>
<p> - Bayes net search procedures can in principle be used for time series, but 
  no practical, consistent, general search procedures are known. The search algorithms 
  in Tetrad can be used to search for "simultaneous" causal relations after&nbsp; 
  regression on lags. </p>
<h3><br>
  Provide provide search procedures to find a common model or models for two or 
  more separate data sets?</h3>
<p>- If the variables in one data set are a subset of those in the other data
  set, a common model can be sought with the present version of Tetrad. If the 
  data sets have entirely distinct variable sets, no principled search procedure
  for a common model is possible. If the data sets contain some common and some
  distinct variables, a sometimes useful principled search is possible, but adequate 
  algorithms have not yet been developed.</p>
