<p> In general, saved sessions for Tetrad are intended to be backwards compatible,
    although with major code releases, so much of the code changes that this is not
    possible. Versions 5.4.* will not be backwards compatiable with versions 5.3.
    For this, we apologize; we can only excuse ourselves by pointing out that we
    have a very small development team, and the codebase is large and multi-pronged,
    and we are using Java serialization, which is fast and accurate but
    finicky. Neverthless, we will try to make sure all versions 5.4* are backwards
    compatible within the 5.4.* series.
</p>
<p>It may halp to know the exact version of the Tetrad softward you are using, for two reasons:
<ol>
    <li>New features are regularly added to Tetrad, and bugs in old features are fixed.
        You may want to to use a version of Tetrad with a specific version of some
        algorithm, or you may simply want to sync your version with a
        version that someone else is using, to avoid any discrepancies.
    </li>
    <li>You may experience some vestigial problems with loading, and you may wish
        to load the sessions in the version used to produce it.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>To find out which exact version of Tetrad you are using, you may use one of
    three methods. </p>
<h3>Method 1 </h3>
<p>In most operating systems, the version number is displayed in the title bar
    above the application. In the example below, it's &quot;5.3.0-0&quot;. The &quot;4&quot;
    in this case is the major version, the first &quot;3&quot; the minor version,
    the &quot;2&quot; the minor subversion, and the &quot;3&quot; the incremental
    release number. This appears in the title bar like this: </p>

<h3>Method 2 </h3>
<p>You can also find the version number by selecting &quot;Session Version&quot; from
    the main File menu: </p>
<p><img src="../images/main_workbench3.png""></p>
<p>Each saved &quot;.tet&quot; file is stamped with a version and a date in such a way that,
    even if the file itself
    cannot be loaded, at least this meta-information can be loaded. So if you have a
    file that won't load, you can still
    see the version it was saved under and the date it was saved. This allows you to
    go to the Tetrad website and launch
    the version of Tetrad that was used to save out the file. You can then load the
    file under that version. </p>
<h3>Method 3 </h3>
