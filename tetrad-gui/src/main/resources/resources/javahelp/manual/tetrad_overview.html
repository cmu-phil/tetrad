<h2>What is Tetrad? </h2>
<p>Tetrad is a program for </p>
<ul>
  <li>creating, </li>
  <li>simulating data from, </li>
  <li>estimating, </li>
  <li>testing, </li>
  <li>predicting with, </li>
  <li>and searching for </li>
</ul>
<p>causal/statistical models. </p>
<p>The aim of the program is to provide sophisticated methods in a friendly interface 
  requiring very little statistical sophistication of the user and no programming 
  knowledge. It is not intended to replace flexible statistical programming systems 
  such as Matlab, Splus or R. Tetrad is freeware that performs many of the functions 
  in commercial programs such as Netica, Hugin, LISREL, EQS and other programs, 
  and many discovery functions these commercial programs do not perform.</p>
<p>Tetrad is unique in the suite of principled search ("exploration," "discovery") 
  algorithms it provides--for example its ability to search when there may be 
  unobserved confounders of measured variables, to search for models of latent 
  structure, and to search for linear feedback models--and in the ability to calculate 
  predictions of the effects of interventions or experiments based on a model. 
  All of its search procedures are "pointwise consistent"--they are guaranteed 
  to converge almost certainly to correct information about the true structure 
  in the large sample limit, provided that structure and the sample data satisfy
  various commonly made (but not always true!) assumptions.</p>
<p>Tetrad is limited to models of categorical data (which can also be used for
  ordinal data) and to linear models ("structural equation models') with a Normal
  probability distribution, and to a <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> 
  limited class of time series models. The Tetrad programs describe causal models 
  in three distinct parts or stages: a picture, representing a directed graph 
  specifying hypothetical causal relations among the variables; a specification 
  of the family of probability distributions and kinds of parameters associated 
  with the graphical model; and a specification of the numerical values of those 
  parameters.</p>
<p>The program and its search algorithms have been developed over several years 
  with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
  Office of Naval Research. Joseph Ramsey has implemented most of the program, 
  with substantial<br>
  assistance from Frank Wimberly. Executable and Source code for all versions 
  of Tetrad IV, and this manual, are copyrighted, 2004, by Clark Glymour, Richard 
  Scheines, Peter Spirtes and Joseph Ramsey. The program may be freely downloaded 
  and used without permission of copyright holders, who reserve the right to alter 
  the program at any time without notification.</p>
<p>The Tetrad suite of programs permits the user to do any of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Generate</span> a graphical statistical/causal&nbsp; 
    model of any of the following kinds:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Models for categorical data (Bayes networks);</li>
    <li>Models for continuous data with variables having a Gaussian (Normal) joint
      probability distribution;</li>
    <li>Models for a limited class of time-series representing genetic regulatory 
      networks..</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Estimate </span>parameters of models of 
    the following kinds:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Models for categorical data in which all variables are recorded in the
      data (no "latent" variables);</li>
    <li>Models for continuous data with or without latent variables;</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Test</span> the fit of models of any of 
    the kinds listed in 2. above.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Simulate</span> data from a model. or
    any of the kinds listed in 1. above.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Update</span> models of categorical data;
    i.e.,, compute the probability of any variable in the model conditional on 
    any set of values for other variables in the model.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Predict</span> the probability of a variable 
    in a model (without latent variables) from interventions that fix or randomize 
    values for any set of other variables in the model.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Search</span> for models:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Of categorical data with or without latent variables;</li>
    <li>Of continuous, Gaussian data with or without latent variables.</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compare </span>graphical features of two 
    models.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Find </span>alternative models statistically 
    equivalent to any given model without latent variables.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Select </span>variables within a dataset 
    for classifying values of cases of another variable in the dataset</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Classify</span> new (or old) cases using 
    the variables selected in 9. above.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Assess</span> the accuracy of classification.</li>
