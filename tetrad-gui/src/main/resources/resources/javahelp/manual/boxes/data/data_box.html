<p>A Data Box in the main workspace looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/data_highlight.gif" width="375" height="67"> </p>
<p>if it's data that's being simulated, or this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/data_standatalone_highlight.gif" width="68" height="66"> </p>
<p>if it's data that was loaded in from an external file.</p>
Most of the time that you interact with the data box, you will be interacting with a Data Set List, which is a list of data sets, one of which (the one you see) is designated as &quot;selected.&quot; For most information, see <a href="data_set_list.html">Data Set Lists</a>.
