<p> The RFCI ("Really Fast Causal Inference", give references) modified the FCI algorithm (see)
    by eliminating some of the expensive steps. The output is slightly less informative than
    FCI, but in most case is identical and is obtained much faster.

<p><em>Note: Zhang (2006) supplies an orientation rule set for FCI that is both arrow-complete and tail-complete; this is not currently implemented</em>. </p>
