<p>A Classify box in the main workspace looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/classify_highlight.gif" width="312" height="69"> </p>
<p>  The operations in the Classify box permit you to use an instantiated model to 
  estimate values for a predictor from a data set--the predictor estimated<br>
  must be in the Instantiated Model, but it need not be in the data set.&nbsp;
  A Classify Box requires input from a Data box containing data and input from
  an Instantiated Model in an IM box. (Remember that you can copy an estimated 
  model in an Estimate box into an IM box simply by putting a flowchart arrow 
  fromthe estimate box to a new IM box.)<br>
  <br>
Here are some things to note: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Instantiated Model can contain variables that are not in the Data</li>
  <li>The Data can contain variables that are not in the Instantiated Model</li>
  <li>The predictor values must all be categorical--a data file with decimal numbers
    will not be accepted by Classify</li>
  <li>The IM must be a Bayes net--either Maximum Likelihood or Dirichlet..</li>
  <li>If the target predictor to be classified has multiple values, the Classifier
    will assign the target predictor its most probable value for each case.</li>
  <li>If the target predictor to be classified has two values, you can specify
    the cut-off probability for classification.</li>
</ul>
The Classifier box will show the graph of the IM used for
classification.. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The original data can be viewed by cliicking the "Test Data" tab.<br>
<br>
Tabs above the graph give choices for how the Classifer will work. You can choose:
<ul>
  <li>The predictor&nbsp; in the IM that is the target--to be classified (you can
    also chose this predictor by clicking on it in the graph.)</li>
  <li>If the target is binary, with only two possible values, you can choose the 
    cut-off value below which the predictor will be classfied one way, and above
    which, the other.</li>
</ul>
When you hit the "Classify" button at the top of the graph window inside the Classify 
box, the Classifier does its work and gives you some viewing choices.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
According to which tab you then click, you can see:
<ul>
  <li>The original data</li>
  <li>The orginal data plus, in the first column, for each case the value of the
    target predictor the classifier predicts.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic;">If the target predictor is included in the data</span>,
the tabs at the top of the Classifier window after the classfication program has 
run will also give you.
<ul>
  <li>A Receiver Operating Characteristic, or ROC curve for short. There is a 
    distinct ROC curve for each value of the target predictor, showing the ratio
    of true positives to false positives as a function of the cutoff value of 
    probabilities for positive classification. ROC curves are traditionally used 
    only with binary variables but the program allows them for muliptle valued 
    variables. </li>
  <li>The Area Under the ROC curve, or AUC</li>
  <li>A Confusion Matrix, showiing, for each value of the target predictor, the
    number of cases having that true value that were predicted (by the classifier) 
    to have&nbsp; each of the possible values of the target predictor.</li>
</ul>
You do not need to leave the Classify Box, or destroy its contents, to
view the ROC curves or Confusion matrices for alternative values of the
target predictor. You do need to do so (or create a new Classify Box) if
you want to classify a different target.<br>
