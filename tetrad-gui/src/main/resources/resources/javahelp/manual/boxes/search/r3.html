<p>The R3 ("Rule 3") algorithm is one of a set of pairwise orientation
    algorithms included. To use it, first somehow
    construct a graph with known adjacencies, by search or by loading a graph from
    a file, and then make an Algorithm box that is a child of the graph in the
    workbench. Then select R3 as the pairwise algorithm to be used. The adjacencies
    in the input graph will oriented by appeal to non-Gaussianity.
