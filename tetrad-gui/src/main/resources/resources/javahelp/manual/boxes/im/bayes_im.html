<h3>Description of the Model</h3>
<p>A Bayes Instantiated Model (Bayes IM) extends a <a href="../pm/bayes_pm.html">Bayes Parameterized Model</a>,
    specifying values for all of the parameters in the Bayes net. The parameters for a Bayes net (in the form that
    they're used in Tetrad) are conditional probabilities stored in <em>conditional probability tables</em>, one for
    each variable in the Bayes net. A variable X has a (possibly empty) list of parents P1, ..., Pn--i.e., variables Pi
    such that Pi--&gt;X in the Bayes PM. The variable itself and each of its parents has a list of categories. A
    conditional probability table for X is a specification of the probability P(X=x' | P1=p1', ..., Pn=pn') for each
    category x' of X and each combination of categories &lt;p1', ..., pn'&gt; for parents P1, ..., Pn of X. For any
    particular combination of parent values &lt;p1', ..., pn'&gt;, the sum of the conditional probabilities P(X=xj |
    P1=p1',...,Pn=pn') for all categories xj of X is equal to 1.0. </p>
<h3><br>
    How to Construct a Bayes IM</h3>
<p>To construct a Bayes IM, first construct a DAG, then a Bayes PM, and add an IM box to the workspace, with an arrow
    from the Bayes PM to the IM.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim1.gif" width="270" height="66"></p>
<p>Fill in the Graph box and the PM box, as explained in <a href="../pm/bayes_pm.html">Bayes Parameterized Model</a>.
    For instance, you might end up with a graph that looks like this (the categories for X1 are shown).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim2.gif" width="919" height="558"></p>
<p>Now, double click the IM box. You get a choice of models; choose Bayes Instantiated Model:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim3.gif" width="414" height="145"></p>
<p>What you click OK, you are offered a choice. You may either initialize the parameters of your Bayes net manually
    (i.e., fill them in one by one, by hand), or fill them in randomly.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim4.gif" width="406" height="207"></p>
<p>We choose &quot;Manually.&quot; We now get a dialog that looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim5.gif" width="911" height="560"></p>
<p>X1 here has two parents, X2 and X5. Each combination of parent values for X2 and X5 is listed as a row in the
    conditional probability table for X1. Each category for X1 is listed as a column in the conditional probability
    table. We can now fill in these probability values however we like, provided we choose non-negative real numbers
    that sum to 1.0 in each row. The interface helps out a little by filling in table cells whose values are implied. If
    you fill in the 0.2000 and 0.5000 in the table below, the table will fill in the 0.3000 for you. Also, if you simply
    want to fill in table cells randomly, right click on any <em>nonselected</em> table cell. You get a popup menu like
    the one below. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim6.gif" width="500" height="271"></p>
<p>If you select &quot;Randomize this row,&quot; the row is filled in with random values. For example: </p>
<p><img src="../../images/bayesim7.gif" width="444" height="243"></p>
<p>Similarly for the other popup menu functions shown.</p>
<p>Once all of the table cells have been filled in, the Bayes IM is ready to be used as input to other boxes. You may,
    for example, simulate data using the Bayes IM, or you may perform updating operations on it. See <a
            href="../../common_tasks/simulating_data.html">Simulating Data (Bayes)</a> for more information on how to
    simulate data and <a href="../update/update_box.html">Update Box</a> for more information on updating. </p>

    Potential Parents for a Bayes IM</h3>
<p>A Bayes IM can be constructed as indicated above (as a child of a Bayes PM). Bayes IM's are also, however, output by
    other processes. In particular, a Bayes IM can be made a child of the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="../estimate/ml_bayes_estimator.html">ML Bayes Estimator</a>. Bayes estimations take <a
            href="../pm/bayes_pm.html">Bayes PM</a>'s and discrete data sets and produce new Bayes IM's.
    </li>
    <li><a href="dirichlet_bayes_im.html">Dirichlet Estimator</a>. Dirichlet estimators also take Bayes PM's and
        discrete data sets (with possibly Dirichlet priors in the form of <a href="dirichlet_bayes_im.html">Dirichlet
            Bayes IM</a>'s) and output Dirichlet Bayes IM's. They may alternatively output Bayes IM's.
    </li>
    <li>Any Bayes updater. All of the Bayes updaters (<a href="../update/row_summing_updater.html">Row Summing
        Updater</a>, <a href="../update/cpt_invariant_updater.html">CPT Invariant Updater</a>, and <a
            href="../update/approximate_updater.html">Approximate Updater</a>) output new, updated Bayes IM's.
    </li>
</ol>

    If you choose an ML Instantiated Bayes Model, the program will either randomly specify the conditional probability
    of each value of each variable given the values of its parents, or you can specify them manually through the dialog
    box:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img
            src="../../images/UBaysesIMcopy.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="495"
            style="width: 859px; height: 495px;"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Choose a variable either using the "Next" button on the right side of the window or by clicking on the variable in
    the graph on the left<br>
    side of the window. In either case, you will see one or more rows of entry spaces, with each entry space labeled by
    the name of the value of the selected variables. Each row corresponds to an allowed assignment of variables to the
    variables that are parents of the selected variable. For each row--each assignment of allowed values to the
    variables that are parents of the variable you have selected--you must enter a numerical value between 0 and 1 for
    each value of the variable you have selected. These are the respective probabilities of the values of your selected
    variable, condiitonal on the values in that row of its parents variables.&nbsp;&nbsp; The numbers you put into any
    row must add up exactly to 1. If they don't the program will simply erase the values you have entered in that row.&nbsp;
    If you start entering numbers in a row from the left, which is highly recommended, the program will automatically
    fill in the next to last entry space with the number (if one exists) needed to make the row numbers sum to 1. <br>
    <br>
    Entering all of these conditional probabilities in even a medium sized model is very tedious, but there is no help
    for it other than to estimate the condiitonal probabilities from a data set, or to randomize.&nbsp; If you
    choose "Random" instead of "Manual" you will get a window very much like the one above, except that randomly chosen
    values will be entered in each row. You can edit these values by clicking on a row and typing. As in other windows
    showing graphs, you can select a variable by clicking on it.</p>
<h3>Potential Parents for Bayes Instantiated Model </h3>
<p>The Bayes IM can accept the following potential parents. </p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="../pm/bayes_pm.html">Bayes Parametric Model</a>. To build a Bayes IM from scratch, one should first
        build a Bayes PM and then construct a Bayes IM as a child of the Bayes PM.
    </li>
    <li><a href="../estimate/dirichlet_estimator.html">ML Bayes Estimator</a>. An ML Bayes Estimator estimates a Bayes
        IM using a given Bayes PM and discrete data set.
    </li>
    <li><a href="../estimate/dirichlet_estimator.html">Dirichlet Bayes Estimator</a>. The normal output of a Dirichlet
        Bayes Estimator is a <a href="dirichlet_bayes_im.html">Dirichlet Bayes IM</a>, but a Bayes Instantiated Model
        may be substituted. This Bayes IM will contains as parameter values the maximum likelihood probability values
        from the estimated Dirichlet Bayes IM.
