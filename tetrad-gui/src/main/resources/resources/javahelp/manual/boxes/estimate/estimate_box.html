<p>An Estimate box in the main workspace looks like this:

  The Estimate program takes a parametrized model (in PM) and a data set
  for the variables in that model, and returns an Instantiated Model,
  an IM. It will also take
  data and an (ML) IM as input.. Once a model is estimated, the contents
  of
  the Estimate box
  can be transferred to an empty IM box&nbsp; and then used to generate
  data, to classify, or to update (in the
  last two cases, only if the model is a Bayes net, not a SEM). <br>
  <br>
  If a Maximum Likelihood Bayes Net and data are directly connected to
  Estimate, the estimation procedures will ignore all cases in the data
  set with missing values for any&nbsp; variables. Missing data values
  can be interpolated by connecing the data to a Manipulate Data box, and
  connecting that box to the Estimator box.<br>
  <br>
  There are several&nbsp; varieties of estimation, depending on
  the.graphical input (the PM or IM):<br>
  <br>
  1. If the input PM&nbsp; or IM&nbsp; is for a SEM, the Estimate program
  immediately produces a full
  information maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters, provided the
  model in the PM or IM is identifiable. Latent variables are allowed.
  The procedure also gives
  model statistics, including
  the implied covariance and correlation matrices, and the chi square
  likelihood ratio statistic and its p value for the model.<br>
  <br>
  2. If the input is a PM for a Bayes Net,&nbsp; the Estimate program
  produces a maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters,
  provided the model has no latent variables..<br>
  <br>
  3. If the input is an Maximum Likelihhod Instatiated Bayes Net (an IM),
  the Estimate program produces a maximum likelihood estimate of the
  model parameters.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>4. If the input is a Dirichlet
  Instantiated Bayes Model,&nbsp; the Dirichlet Bayes estimator estimates
  a posterior Dirichlet Bayes
  instantiated model given a prior Dirichlet Bayes instantiated model and
  a a discrete data set. The data set must contain all of the same
  variables as the prior instantiated model.
  Latent variables are not allowed.<br>
  <br>
  The Dirichlet estimation algorithm is simple. First, a new (blank)
  posterior
  Dirichlet Bayes IM is created. Then, for each cell in the posterior,
  the value (a) from the corresponding cell in the prior is retrieved,
  and the number of cases in the data satisfying the condition of that
  cell (n) is counted. The value of the cell in the posterior is set to a
  + n. Estimated conditional probabilities total pseudocount in each row
  are calculated from these cell values. <br>
  <br>
  As a shortcut, it is possible in the interface to use a Bayes PM and a
  discrete data set as parents to the Dirichlet Bayes Estimator. If you
  do this, a symmetric Dirichlet Bayes IM will be generated in the
  background and used as the prior for the Dirichlet estimation
  algorithm. The symmetric pseudocount that should be used here may be
  specified at time of construction. <br>
  <br>
  In its present implementation, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bayes
  nets with
latent variables cannot be estimated. </span></p>
