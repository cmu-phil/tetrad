<p>The search box in the main workspace area looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/search_from_data_highlight.gif" width="196" height="67"></p>
<p>if the search is being conducted over a data set, or this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/search_from_graph_highlight.gif" width="197" height="67"></p>
<p>if the search is being conducted directly over a graph (as a source of true conditional independence facts, to see how the algorithm behaves ideally).</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Tetrad has a variety of search algorithms to assist in 
searching for causal explanations of a body of data.</font></p>
<p>It should be noted that the Tetrad search procedures are exponential in the worst case (when all pairs of variables are dependent conditional on every other set of variables.) The search procedures may take a good bit of time, and there is no guarantee beforehand as to how long that will be.</p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;These search algorithms are
different from those conventionally used in statistics.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000000">There are several search algorithms, differing in the assumptions they make.<br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Many of the search algorithms allow the user to specify background information that will be used in the search procedure. In many cases the search results will be uninformative unless such background assumptions are explicitly made. This design not only provides for more flexibility, it also encourages the user to be conscious of the additional assumptions imposed in deriving a model from data.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Even with background assumptions, data often do not determine a unique best or robust explanation. The search algorithms take in data and return information about a <span style="font-style: italic;">collection</span> of alternative causal graphs that can explain features of the data. They do not usually return a unique graph, although they sometimes will if sufficient prior knowledge is specified. In contrast</font><font
 color="#000000">, if one searches for a regression model of the influences of a set of variables on a selected variable, a regression model will certainly be found (provided there are sufficient data points), specifying which variables influence the target and which do not. <br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000"> The algorithms are in some respects cautious. Search algorithms such as FCI and PC , described below, will often say, correctly, that it cannot be determined whether or not a particular variable influences another.<br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">The algorithms are not just useful guesses.&nbsp; Under explicit assumptions (which often hold at best only approximately), the algorithms are "pointwise consistent"--they converge almost surely to the correct answer. The conditions for this sort of consistency of the seaarch procedures are described in the references. Conventional model search algorithms--stepwise regression, for example--have such guarantees only under very strong prior assumptions about the causal structure.<br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">The output of the search algorithms provides a variety of indirect information about how much the conclusions of the algorithm can be trusted. They can, for example, be run repeatedly for a variety of specifications of depErrorsAlpha values in their statistical tests, to gain insight about robustness. For search algorithms such as PC, CCD, GES and MimBuild, described below,&nbsp; if the search algorithms return "spaghetti"--a highly connected graph--that indicates the serach cannot determine whether all of the connected variables may be influenced&nbsp; by a common unmeasured cause. If the PC algoirthm returns an edge with two arrowheads, that indicates a latent variable may be acting; if searches other than CCD return graphs with cycles, that indicates the assumptions of the search algoirthm are violated. <br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Some of the search procedures are robust against common difficulties in sampling designs--they give correct, but reduced information in such cases. For example, the FCI algorithm allows that there may be unobserved latent common causes of measured variables--or not--and that the sample may have been formed by a process in which the values of measured variables invlucne whether or not a unit is included in the sample (<span style="font-style: italic;">sample selection bias</span>). The CCD algorithm allows that the correct causal structure may be "non-recursive"--essentially a cyclic graphical mode, a folded up time series.<br>
  </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">The output of the algorithms is not an estiamted model with parameter values, but a discription of a class of causall graphs that can explain statistical features of the data considered by the search procedures. That information can be converted by hand into particular graphical models in the form of directed graphs, which can then be estimated by the program and tested.</font></li>

<h3>Inputs to the Search Box
</h3>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two possible inputs for a search
algorithm: a data set or a graph. If a graph is input, the program
allows searches the program computes implied independence and
conditional independence relations and allows you to conduct any search
that uses only such constraints--the PC, FCI and CCD algorithms.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Why would you apply a Search procedure to a
model you already know?&nbsp; For a very important reason: The Search
procedures will find the graphical representation of alternative
models&nbsp; to your model that imply the same constraints. </font></p>
The more usual use of the search algorithms requires a data set as
input. Here is an example.

<p><font color="#000000">Tetrad offers the following choices of search
algorithms. For more details about the assumptions and parameters
needed for each algorithm, click in the respective links. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two main classes of algorithms. The
first one is designed for general graphs with or without assuming the
possibility of hidden common causes:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000"><b><a href="pc.html">PC algorithm</a></b>: 
    this method assumes that there are no hidden common causes between observed
    variables in the input (i.e., variables from the data set, or observed variables
    in the input graph) and that the graphical structure sought has no cycles.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000"><b><a href="fci.html">FCI algorithm</a></b>: 
    this method does not assume that there are no hidden common causes between
    observed variables in the input (i.e., variables from the data set, or observed
    variables in the input graph); it does assume that the graphical strucutre 
    sought has no cycles.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000"><b><a href="ccd.html">CCD algorithm</a></b>: 
    this method assumes there are no hidden common causes; it allows cycles; it
    is only correct for discrete variables under a restrictive assumtptions<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000"><b><a href="ges.html">GES algorithm</a></b>: 
    same assumptions as the PC algorithm, except that this one performs search 
    by scoring a graph by its asymptotic posterior probability.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">The second class concerns algorithms to search
for&nbsp; latent variable structural equation models from data and
background knowledge.<br>
</font></p>

<p>Select the desired algorithm that meets your assumptions from the
Search list. An initial dialog box showing the search parameters you
can set is displayed. The following figure illustrates the one that is
displayed when PC Algorithm is selected.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><img src="../../images/pcsearch_dialog.png"
 width="268" height="209"></font></p>
<p>After the proper parameters are set, if the user checks the box
"Execute searches automatically", the automated search procedure will
start when the OK button is clicked. The respective Help button can be
used to get instructions about that specific algorithm. The next window
displays the result of the procedure, and can also be used to fire new
searches. The following figure illustrates an output for the PC
algorithm.</p>

<p><font color="#000000"><b><br>
  Inserting background knowledge</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Besides the assumptions underlying each
    algorithm, another source of constraints that can be used by the search
    procedures to narrow down the search and return a more informative
output is making use of background knowledge provided by the user. To see how to specify background knowledge for a search algorithm, see <a href="../../common_tasks/editing_knowledge.html">Editing Knowledge</a>.</font></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assumptions<br>
  <br>
</span>A search procedure is pointwise consistent if as the sample size
increases without bound, the output of the algorithm converges with
probability 1 to<br>
true information about the data generating structure. For all of the
Tetrad search algorithms, available proofs of pointwise consistency,
assume at least the following:<br>
<br>
1. The sample is i.i.d--the probaiblity of any unit in a population
being sampled is the same as any other, and the joint probability
distribution of the variables is the same for all units.<br>
<br>
2. The joint probability distribution is locally Markov. In acyclic
cases, this is equivalent to a simpler "global" Markov condition:&nbsp;
that a variable is independent of all variables that are not its
effects conditional on the direct causes of the variable in the causal
graph (its "parents"). In cyclic cases, the local Markov condition has
a related but more technical definition. (See Spirtes, et al., 2000).<br>
<br>
3. All of the independence and conditional independence relations in
the joint probability distribution are consequences of the local Markov
condition for the true causal graph.<br>
<br>
In addition, various specific search algorithms impose other assumptions. Of course, 
the search algorithms<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> may</span> give&nbsp; correct in information when 
these assumptions do not strictly hold, and in some cases will do so when they 
are grossly violated--the PC algoirthm, for example, will sometimes correctly 
identify the presence of unrecorded common causes of recorded variables.</p>
