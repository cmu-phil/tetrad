<p> This interface supports algorithms of different types, as follows.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pattern algorithm. This type of algorithms generates an equivalencle class of
    directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), encoded as a set os adjacencies over the variables
    of the search, some of which (but not all) are given a direction. All DAGs in the
    equivalence class share the same adjacencies, but some directions are not given
    in the output. To obtain each DAG in the equivalence class, pick an edge that's
    not oriented and orient it. Then apply the orient rules given in Meek, ??. Then
    in the new graph, pick another edge that's not oriented, and do the same. Once
    all edge have been oriented either by choice or by implication, the resulting
    DAG will be a member of the equivelence class. All members of the equivalence
    class can be obtained in this way by different choices of orientation, and they
    are all statistically equivalence if the data are from a linear, Gaussian model
    or the algorithm uses only conditional independence information as data.
    For pattern algorithms, it is assumed that there are no latent common causes
    in the model--that is, there can be latents, but there cannot be structures of
    the following form: X<-L->Y, where X and Y are measured and L is not.</li>
    <li>PAG (Partial Ancestral Graph) algorithm. This is the class of equivalence
    classes of graphs one obtains if one assumes latent common causes (as above)
    might exist, one knows not where, and the algorithms uses only conditional
    information as data (or the data are distributed as linear, Gaussian). The
    definition of a PAG is given in Spirtes et al., 2000. An edge between X and Y
    implies that X and Y are dependent conditional on all subsets of other
    measured variables. And arrow at Y, X*->Y, where * means any endpoint, implies
    that Y is not an ancestor of X. A tail at X, X--*Y, implies that X is an
    ancestor of Y. Arrows at both endpoint, X<->Y, imply that there is a latent
    common cause of X and Y. Tails at both endpoints, X---Y, imply that there is
    selection bias for X and Y. A circle at either endpoint, say, Xo->Y, means
    that the endpoint in question may be either an arrow or a tail.</li>
    <li>DAG algorithm. In the last many years at this point, algorithms have been
    developed appealing to non-Gaussianity or nonlinearity, that are able to
    distinguish between DAGs in a pattern or PAG and in many cases pick which
    one corresponds to the truth. Our representation of such algorithms in Tetrad
    is still fairly meager, but we hope to improve.</li>
    <li>Markov blanket. One question that's often been raised is to find the Markov
    blanket of a target variable in a data set--that is, a minimal set of variables
    conditional on which all other variables are independent of the target.
    Under faithfulness, for DAG models, there can be just one, although if faithfulness
    fails to hold, there can be many. This is a well studied problem. A related
    problem is to find the graphical structure over the variables in the
    Markov blanke, taken together with the target variables. We give some
    algorihtms that address this issue; many more exist in the literature.</li>
    <li>Undirected Graph. In some cases, what one wants is an undirected graph over
    the variables. We give one such algorithms, FAS, which yields the skeleton
    of a pattern over measured variables. For FAS, parents X and Z for X->Y<-X
    where X and Z are not adjacent are not married--that is, there is not adjacency
    X--Z in the output. For other algorithms, there is such adjacency; these output
    what's known as a Markov random field--that is, the undirected skeleton of a
    DAG model in which all parents are married.</li>
    <li>Pairwise. One thing one can do with an undirected graph, if the data are
    non-Gaussian or nonlinear, is to orient the edges pairwise. Not that pattern
    algorithms and PAG algorithms cannot do this. For instance, if the true model
    is X->Y->Z, the pattern for this will be X--Y--Z, indicating that the true model
    is X->Y->Z or X<-Y<-Z or X<-Y->Z, but not indicating which one it is. This is
    the best that one can do if the data are linear and Gaussian. If, however, the
    assumptions of linearity and Gaussianit prove false, it may be possible to
    figure out which one of those models it correct. Under the right conditions,
    it may be possible to orient just a single edge, X--Y, say, as either X->Y
    or X<-Y. We refer to algorithms that do this as pairwise orientation algrorithms
    and include several options. Many more options exist.</li>
