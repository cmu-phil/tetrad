</b><b>Introduction </b></font></p>
<p>Purify is one of the three algorithms in Tetrad designed to build <font color="#000000"><b><a
        href="../../definitions/measurement_structural_graph.html">pure
    measurement/structural models</a></b></font> (the others are the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="mimbuild.html">MIM
    Build algorithm</a></b></font> and the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="purify.html">Purify
    algorithm</a></b></font>).</p>
<p> Purify should be used to select indicators of a given measurement model such
    that the selected indicators form a pure measurement model<font color="#000000">.
        In other words, the user specifies a set of clusters of indicators, where each
        cluster containts indicators of an assumed latent variable. The task of Purify
        is to discard any indicator that is impure, i.e., that may have other common
        causes with other indicators, or that is a direct cause of other indicators.</font></p>
<p>The Purify algorithm assumes that the population can be described as a measurement/structural
    model where observed variab<font color="#000000">les are linear indicators of
        the unknown latents, and that the given measurement model is correct, but perhaps
        impure. Notice that linearity among latents is not necessary (although it will
        be necessary for the <b><a href="mimbuild.html">MIM Build algorithm</a></b>)
        and latents do not need to be continuous. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">All variables are assumed to be continuous, and therefore
    the current implementation of the algorithm accepts only continuous data sets
    as input. For general information about model building algorithms, consult the
    <font color="#000000"><b><a href="../../search/../search.html">Search Algorithms</a></b></font>
    page.</font></p>

    Entering Purify parameters</b></font></p>
<p>Create a new <font color="#000000">Search
    nodes</font> as described in the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="../../search/../search.html">Search
    Algorithms</a></b></font> page, but in order to follow this tutorial, use the
    following graph to generate a simulated continuous data set:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000"><img src="../../images/purify1.png" width="790" height="470"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that, in this example, X4, X5 and X7 are in impure relations. Notice
    also that X4 is not an impurity anymore when X7 is removed, but X5 and X7 cannot
    be made pure, since they are indicators of two latents. </p>
<p>When the Purify algorithm is chosen from the Search Object combo box, the following
    window appears:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000"><img src="../../images/purify2.png" width="297" height="309"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parameters that are used by Purify can be specified in this window. The
    parameters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>alpha value</strong>: Purify uses statistical hypothesis tests in
        order to generate models automatically. The alpha value parameter represents
        the level by which such tests are used to accept or reject constraints that
        compose the final output. The default value is 0.05, but the user may want
        to experiment with different alpha values in order to test the sensitivity
        of her data within this algorithm.
    </li>
    <li><strong>number of clusters</strong>: Purify needs a measurement model specified
        in advance. The measurement model is defined by a set of clusters of variables,
        where each cluster represents a set of pure indicators of a single latent.
        In this box, the user specifies how many latents there are in the measurement
        model based in prior knowledge. In our example, assuming we know the true
        measurement model, let's use three clusters.
    </li>
    <li><strong>edit cluster assignments</strong>: this is identical to the cluster
        editor of the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="mimbuild.html">MIM Build algorithm</a></b></font>.
        Consult its documentation for details. In our example, we should create the
        following clustering:
        <p><font color="#000000"><img src="../../images/purify3.png" width="590" height="319"></font></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>statistical test</strong>: as stated before, automated model building
        is done by testing statistical hypothesis. Purify provides two basic statistical
        tests that can be used. Wishart's Tetrad ssumes that the given variables follow
        a multivariate normal distribution. Bollen's Tetrad test not make this assumption.
        However, it needs to compute a matrix of fourth moments, which can be time
        consuming. It is also less robust against sampling variability when compared
        to Wishart's test if the data actually follows a multivariate normal distribution.
    </li>
    <li><strong>default mode</strong>: there are basically two different strategies
        used by Purify. In the <em>Impure by default</em> mode, the algorithm does
        not assume that the user believes the measurement model is pure, and therefore
        will try to find constraints that guarantees that a indicator is pure with
        respect to other indicators. If it fails to find a condition by which indicator
        A is pure with respect to indicator B, then A will be marked as impure with
        respect to B. In the <em>Pure by default </em>mode, the algorithm assumes
        that the given measurement model is pure. It will try to find constraints
        that guarantees that a indicator is impure with respect to other indicators.
        If it fails to find a condition by which indicator A is impure with respect
        to indicator B, then A will be marked as pure with respect to B.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Execute the search as explained in the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="../../search/../search.html">Search

</b><b>Interpreting the output</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Although a given measurement model may have many different
    pure submodels, the Purify algorithm has a deterministic output: it will basically
    throw away indicators that violate constraints, following an order determined
    by the number of constraints that are violated by each indicator. It returns
    a pure measurement model. In our example, the outcome should be as follows if
    the sample is representative of the population:</font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000"><img src="../../images/purify4.png" width="392" height="371"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edges with circles at the endpoints are added only to distinguish latent variables
    from the indicators. Purify does not make any claims about the causal relationships
    among latent variables (this is the role of the <font color="#000000"><b><a href="mimbuild.html">MIM
        Build algorithm</a></b></font>). The labels given to the latent variables are
    arbitrary.</p>
<p>Sometimes some latents will not have any indicator. As an important sidenote,
    if some cluster has only two variables, Purify cannot find any condition by
    which the two indicators in this cluster can be considered pure. If the <em>Impure
        by default</em> method is chosen, such indicators will always be removed.</p>
