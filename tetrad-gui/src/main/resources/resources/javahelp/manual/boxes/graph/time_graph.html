  If instead of "Regular Graph" you click on "Time Series Graph" you will obtain 
  a quite different window in which you can introduce variables named "Gene n". 
  Currently the Time Series Graphs have very limited use for generating simulated 
  data. Currently only a single dependency function is implemented, a generalization
  of the Glass model of gene expression.<br>

  <br>
  As soon as you introduce a variable, an edge appears directed from that variable 
  into itself&nbsp; with a number 1 attached.&nbsp; That is because you are seeing 
  a compact representation of a time series, in which the structure in the Directed 
  Graph window is repeated over and over. The number attached to an edge<br>
  indicates the time delay (in steps of arbitrary time measure) for the infljuence 
  represented by the directed edge to occur. <br>
  <br>
  You can add and delete variables, change their names, add and delete directed 
  edges, and change the time delays (by double clicking on a number).<br>
  Unlike with "Regular" graphs, a time series directed graph can have two or more 
  edges between variables, so long each such edge has a different number. These 
  multiple edges represent influences with different time delays. <br>
  <br>
  . You can see a graphical depiction of&nbsp; the time series itself by clicking 
  on "Repeating Graph":<br>

  This representation of the time series graph that comes up&nbsp; is sometimes 
  a bit messy. Clicking on the :"Clean Up" tool button cleans it up a bit. <br>
  <br>
  There are 3 buttons on the top menu of the "Repeating Graph": Lag Graph, Hybrid 
  Graph and Repeating Graph.<br>
  <br>
  Lag graph shows only the repeating structure. Hybrid Graph, which is often the 
  most revealing, shows one instance of the repeating structure highlighted and 
  other repetitions dimmed. Repeating Graph shows a long series of repetitions 
  all highlighted. The picture above is of a Hybrid graph. The graphical<br>
  structures are the same in all three choices; only the display is different.<br>
  <br>
  You can make the same sorts of changes in the Repeating Graph window that you 
  can make in the Directed Graph window.<br>
  <br>
  The Table View will show which variables each variable depends on, and the lags.<br>
  <br>
  The File menu is currently useless..<br>
