IMPORTANT!

These files in this directory are used by Tetrad in the process of publishing
new versions:

copyright
license
version

The 'copyright' file contains a message that will appear to users when they
start Tetrad. The 'license' file contains the text of the GNU GPL license,
as posted at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt.

The 'version' file contains the version number of the most recently
published version of Tetrad. It is updated automatically each time the Ant
upload task is executed.

The 'version' file normally contains a string of this form as
its first line:

    a.b.c

where a is the major version, b the minor version, c the
minor subversion. For example:

    5.3.0

No other string types are permitted; anything else will cause
the lifecycle package goal to fail.

This currently needs to be coordinated manually with the POM file.
Might have to give this up.

The configuration file that Tetrad uses is configuration.xml. The file
configuration-post contains the version that's used for posting;
configuration-play contains experimental items. Trying to figure out
how to get Tetrad to automatically choose between the latter using
Maven but haven't figured it out yet.
